Now, let's talk about the food – it was exceptional! The selection of cured meats and cheeses was outstanding, each bite bursting with flavor and expertly paired with complementary accompaniments. Every item on the platter was clearly sourced with care and attention to quality.

Not only was the charcuterie top-notch, but the service was also impeccable. Paula was knowledgeable about the products and provided excellent recommendations based on our preferences. Their passion for good food was evident in every interaction.

To top it all off, the presentation was exquisite. Each platter was beautifully arranged, making it almost too pretty to eat (but of course, we couldn't resist!).

Prices are not cheap, but an evening at BXL is like an evening in Europe without having to fly there!

Beers are about $14, 2 lbs of mussels cost $28. They have an all you can eat mussel special on Sunday and Monday that I have made a mental note to go back for sometime — Yum!

This time I had my mussels marinière style, with white wine and shallots, which was delicious and light. Upon request, they brought some delicious baguette to soak into the broth.

Last time I had the mussels grande-mère style with cream and bacon, which was equally delicious, but definitely more filling.

My partner had the steak frites, which was definitely a nice portion, and cooked to perfection.

We were tempted by the waffle for dessert, but just did not have the room, especially after a Duvel or two!

This place is truly a neighborhood gem.

The bolognese itself did not seem to be cooked with soffritto, which is known as mirepoix in French cooking. Nor did it have any form of guanciale, pancetta or bacon, and there was very little meat in it which consisted of ground beef. Plus, the bolognese had more of a creamy flavor profile than a tomatoey one. It’s possible that the creaminess came from ricotta, which would be more tolerable for a lasagne, but that’s not what I ordered. There was not even a speck of parmigiano-reggiano, or pecorino detected. It also clearly was not cooked for multiple hours.
Moving to the pasta, bolognese is only supposed to be served with egg fresh pasta like tagliatelle or pappardelle. Even the dried version of mezzi rigatoni would have been an excellent choice. Spaghetti is too thin to capture the sauce of the bolognese, more so for the meat in which it was made with. Spaghetti is better suited for dishes such as pasta al pomodoro, cacio e pepe, or carbonara.
I was not expecting this dish to be one-hundred percent authentic, but if you have something classic like a bolognese on the menu, at least present it as if the sweet, neighborhood Nonna made it. Nonna is not proud, and every time an authentic, classic Italian dish is prepared incorrectly, a nonna loses her wings. This dish would disappoint not only all the nonne in the Emilia-Romagna region, but the entire continent of Europe. And should be reported to the Embassy of Bologna.
There are a few things I will give praise for. The pasta was cooked al dente, and while not heavy handed, I could tell the pasta water was salted. The dish, spaghetti and meatballs did not exist on the menu, at least to my knowledge. Plus, I admired that the serving of pasta was adequate and not an entire box piled in a mountain on my plate. Also, while others may not find it enjoyable, I appreciated the dim lighting. Not to mention, I was fond of how the tap water we were drinking came in green, glass bottles, that way I could at least pretend we were drinking S. Pellegrino. Molto bene!
Finally, I would like to state the following, Delaware River water > Hudson River water. And please learn how to properly pronounce the word Bolognese.

Been here few times and we have had decent experience but today was last time. We cannot handle unethical behaviour. Service was really bad. Some items i ordered never arrived but were on the bill. I asked for a revised bill and gave my credit card before the revised bill came in good trust  In the 1st bill no gratutity of 22% was charged.
I was going to add my own tip but the bill was sent back for correction.But when i blindly gave my card i was 22%  as gratuity on 2nd bill. I did not say anything as we usually tip 30 to 40% of the total anywhere but i was very put off first by the service going bad to worse last few times and now this!!
