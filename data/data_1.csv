It was so salty I couldn't eat it without getting sick, despite the overall flavor being good.  The Fried Rice and Basil Stir-Fry were the opposite and needed extra soy sauce to give them flavor.  Additionally there was a piece missing from my order.  Probably wont be ordering from this vendor again, unfortunately.",,
