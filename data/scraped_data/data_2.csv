The waitress was quick to our table.  My husband ordered the CF Steak breakfast.  I ordered a Chef Salad after confirming 'it wasn't too early to order a salad'.
Meals were served.  This is the second time of three visits that my chef salad arrived without the hard-boiled egg touted on the menu.  
The first time this happened, I wasn't told there were no hard-boiled eggs until after the salad was in front of me and I pointed out that there was no egg.  I didn't want to upset our meal, so I dropped it.  And paid full price for that 'chef' salad without an egg.  
Same thing yesterday.  The salad arrived.  No egg.   We called the waitress over.  I began ... ""The only reason I order a Chef Salad is ..."" ... and the waitress finished my sentence .. ""For the egg.""   
I replied ""Yes, for the egg.""  Isn't that the cornerstone of a chef salad?
I asked, ""Will we be charged full price for the salad?""  The waitress replied, ""Yes"".
I gave her the salad back.  The waitress asked if I'd like to order something else.  I replied, ""Not now.""  (At this point, it didn't seem wise to ask a cook to make something else after sending food back.)
Point:  The waitress knows there are no eggs but doesn't say anything when I ordered.  The cook knows too.  If my husband ordered an extra egg for his breakfast, he would have been charged the ala carte price.
A Chef Salad is offered on the menu ... with an egg.  Without the egg ... it's not a chef salad. 
Seems like a pattern ... 'maybe you'll get an egg, maybe you won't, but you'll pay for it either way ...'
Disappointing.  Very disappointing.
Chef Salad = egg.   If you don't have them (again) ... say so up front.    
My husband's meal was fine.",Dis-egg-pointed.  Again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g47119-d3395549-r967329752-Iron_Skillet-Milan_New_Mexico.html

So, for some unknown reason, we took another chance. Wish now, we hadn’t stopped. 
       After today, Im thinking this new fellow is the old cook’s brother. The chicken breast was so dried out, it wasn’t edible. Sent it back, and was replaced by a version of chicken fried steak; which was just as badly over cooked. On the flip, the so called Baked potato (microwaved), wasn’t cooked all the way through. Salad bar was lacking many of the normal veggies. Soup looked like it was made about a week ago. BTW, Service was just ok, and not very friendly. 
      I’m not sure what has happened to this chain of restaurants; as Petro used to be one of the better choices on the road. But, like most truck stops, they just don’t care anymore. Did I complain? Of course: Did it matter? Not at all.

This one in Milan is about as bad as I’ve had. I learned a long time ago to stay clear of the buffet all together: Although I do think the location in north Little Rock, AR is decent. So, here I Ordered a sirloin with fried shrimp, which comes with the salad bar. Petro used to have a pretty good salad bar, but this one is lacking too many regular items. 
    Now I realize these steaks are not coming from Ruth Chris, but the cuts they’re buying must be the lowest grade possible. The steak(ordered med-rare) comes out dry, flat, and about 3/8” thick. So, since they clearly cooked that one med-well, they try again. This time the next steak wasn’t even rare: More like raw. I asked them to take it off please; and it was like an act of Congress to get this done. 
     On top of all this, the service was lousy. Drinks were never refilled, and the server was absent most of the time. We did see her talking and cutting up with a “regular” as others were waiting for her as well. Management here isn’t much better. We would’ve have eaten elsewhere, if not for the enormous points we had built up, (from buying so much fuel) for a free meal. But,That one is on ME!!!.... “you get what u pay for”...

Otherwise, understand that it is difficult to maintain “hot off the grill” food temperature from a buffet.

It's near us and it's family run which is the type of business that is worth supporting.  Mikayla's has had no trouble filling the several tables so the people waiting outside seem to be a harbinger of trendiness.  It seems that the crowds are thinner now; no wait on a Sunday 10:15 am.

  You see little signs scattered among sports and random pictures on the wall telling you to get a table and then go to the cashier to order.  People might be too interested in their phone or company to notice.  It's an odd arrangement to say the least.  They may come out to take an order, they may not.  Either way, you place your order and wait for your meal that is actually table service.

  Weak service:  Forgot part of my guest's order, never refilled a coffee, never checked up on us and then you go stand in line to pay.  If you want a napkin or water, be prepared to get up and ask.  That falls a little (or a lot) short of full service.  Carl's Jr. is similar but doesn't presume a tip.

  Good food:  Not great but filling.  They serve one slice of toast, blackened.  The rest of the portions were better cooked and filled the plate.  The recipes are good, the execution is fair but I can't get past the notion that Mikayla's takes the customer for granted as they've got a location near the stadium without a whole lot of competition on that side of town.  Once the hype dies down and the regulars find another hot spot, we'll see if they can stay in business.",Service needs some improvement,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33046-d10461367-r452249979-Mikayla_s_Cafe-Santa_Clara_California.html

And while my wife and I dined there, we were surrounded by people for whom WB was perfect, because they were all grabbing a quick dinner before departing for the Avalanche hockey game at Ball Arena. (Quick aside: WB is perfectly located for pre- and post-game fans of every Denver pro team--though the Broncos are a bit of a hike.) What's more, the restaurant occupies the east wing of Denver's gorgeously restored Union Station, which benefits WB to the tune of a 3-story high ceiling and wonderful feeling of spaciousness and light. Also quite pleasant is the monetary bottom line: $101 for the two of us, including all taxes and fees, cocktail and wine, and 25% tip to our very competent and wise-cracking server.

A beautiful small little bakery near the Irving Mall. The location was little off and not best place, but once you are inside it was a beautiful place and very inviting. 

I tried a mix of most of the Pastries on offer and the representative at the store was very helpful. Also tried the Flan (Mango Flan) it was very very delightful. 

I would have given 5 stars for this place based on taste but going with 4 stars for the location and the prices (which I feel are a little on the expensive side). 

I will surely recommend this place though.",One of the best Bakeries in DFW,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56032-d3202738-r322657638-Argentina_Bakery-Irving_Texas.html

First of all, there was no a/c. With outside temperatures over 90 degrees and high humidity, they had the door open for some ventilation. It did not work...
At 6pm, the restaurant was not full, a few occupied tables, a few empty. But we were so rushed, and I really don't understand why.
We sat down, ordered in a few minutes, then appetizers arrived right away. We were still eating them, when less than 10 minutes later they came to clean up the table because the entrees were ready. The appetizers were good, and we had to ask for a few more minutes to finish them. They literally gave us a couple more minutes, then entrees arrived, we ate...and that was it. We did not want desert, so check came and we were out in less than 45 minutes.

On our way back from New York Yesterday we decided to try Cinar for the first time. We have dined at numerous restaurants in the area and Cinar set a new standard.
Service: Prompt, polite and pleasant. Always available without being overbearing.
Decor - Makes the best of a challenging environment. Attractive without being too cusey.
Food: The Main event. Opening with the Cinar and a Spicy salad, both lip smacking and a meal unto themselves. Accompanied by fresh warm bread (already a winner). The main dishes were:
Turkish Dumplings Manti
A light dough stuffed with ground lamb and onions steamed to perfection, served with seasonings and garlic yogurt sauce. ASK FOR EXTRA GARLIC
Absolutely amazing!
Ali Nazik
Smoked eggplant puree with ground lamb and garlic yogurt.
EXTRA GARLIC and we had the shish instead of ground lamb. 
Finished off with the custard dessert.
The only shame is that we didn't have more room to try more. We will have to go back with friends, Many times!

These delectable morsels were served to me by head Chef Serhat Asik, a 2-star Guide Michelin chef, who ordered them delivered fresh, steamed them, made the rice with his signature spice blend and put them in front of me for lunch.
If you've never had midye (OK, don't go to Google, it's steamed mussels with spiced rice, served cold) this is the place. Tunc Ozlu, the owner, brought over a Niçoise with some of the tastiest shrimp I've had all month. Sorry, I eat my weight in shrimp every 2 months. These shrimp were tender and gently spiced but sweet to the tongue.
The other dish I tasted was a poached salmon over slices of red beets that was so tender you didn't need teeth. I like red beets so they all went down the craw.
When my Turkish coffee was ready, Celik, our attentive server brought a sour cherry tart and a blueberry tart, both which are baked daily at Tunc's Divan Cafe, only 4 doors south.
The deeply rich and sweet demi tasse was sipped in between bites of those tarts. Deciding which was better was like picking a favorite child. OK, the blueberry was sweeter.

For years we were looking for a bakery experience like I grew up with in Europe, and this, oddly enough, comes very close. From the first time we found it, we knew this would be a great place. A small bakery-cafe, with limited items imported from Argentina for sale (a variety of mate and related items, spices, coffee, a case full of bread and imported sausages), an array of coffee and tea drinks, empanadas and, of course, the ever-growing variety of desserts. Lately they added an extra case for cupcakes and cake balls to go with the current fad in dessertdom, and business-wise it was a very shrewd decision. I always choose from their original items, but my daughter got swayed by the cherry-topped cupcakes once or twice.
The interior is great, always decorated according to season and comfy, with its big inviting leather chairs on the side begging to spend a couple of hours reading or catching up on e-mail, and the more traditional chair-and-table arrangements in the middle and a couple of chairs outside. The line of glass cases as you enter holds a bewildering array of sweets, cakes and desserts. A lot of them are made with dulce de leche, which I personally find a bit too sweet, but most Americans should have no problems with it. I normally end up with one of the Piononos--cake rolls filled with fruit jam and either dusted with sugar or coconut, or covered in chocolate. Their tiramisu cake is surprisingly light and authentic-tasting, while their Eclair is one of the best I've sampled in the metroplex.
The empanadas are fresh and baked on site behind the counter:  try the beef with jalapeno (delightfully spicy with the little pieces of egg countering the sharpness of the jalapenos perfectly), or the spinach-ricotta (soft cheese and pepper-studded chopped spinach, yum!). My little one's favorite is the simple Ham &Cheese.
The coffee is fresh, and the large earthenware mugs are great to hold and sip from while looking around and listening to the other patrons and the soft music. This is not pretentious or artsy, there's no weird wibe or flashy baristas: they just, simply, give you a slice of a culture that, in my opinion, should feature more in our everyday life.
Try it.",A cozy place to rest and  relax,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56032-d3202738-r151557302-Argentina_Bakery-Irving_Texas.html

So delicious and unique presentation ( no bacon and you won't miss it. ) They offer a half and half so second time around I had the Turkey half sandwich with my Veggie Green Chili order while my husband went for their huge bowl of mac n'cheese to go with his Veggie Green Chili, which he combined the 2 after a while. Another pleasant experience was meeting Justin working behind the bar on both our visits. Justin is the kind of person you want running the bar. He was friendly, engaging, worked constantly, on top of everything, serving and keeping up easily with everyone at the bar but as my husband aptly noticed was that when Justin was talking with you, he was talking with you! He was not distracted looking off or around the room. Not only that, but he remembered us after our visit a week earlier! This kind of service makes for a meaningful experience we will long remember as one of the highlights of our entire trip. Thank you, Justin, for the great Denver hospitality. You made our visit to Denver really fun and enjoyable.

It is open seating so it may be have to commandeer tables as they become available and pull them together if you have a large group.  Also, there is no waitstaff so you have to order your beer(s) from the bar and then stand in line to place your order with the kitchen.

I started with a beer, the draft selection left much to be desired, but it was happy hour, so I got a 16oz. Blue Moon for $1. No complaints there. To eat I enjoyed steak fingers with tots and okra.

We were peckish but not starving so chose the Brewhouse Sampler to pick at. Unfortunately both the sliders and the pretzel knots were dry and not particularly flavoursome. 
The couple next to us had to send their first order of wings back as they were the wrong ones and then barely touched the second portion claiming they were cold and didn't taste like buffalo wings at all. Maybe the kitchen was just having a bad day.
The beer is better although I wasn't a massive fan of any of my beers on my beer flight on the first night we visited apart from the stout. 
When we returned for the brewery tour a couple of days later we had a much more positive beer experience. The tour was fun and informative, the beer plentiful and much better than we were expecting following the first night.

Once to try the beer and a second for dinner. Both times were very good! 

I’ll start with dinner. I had the Bison Burger. Very tasty! I’ve had bison in the past, and this one didn’t disappoint. I ordered it medium-well, and it was not dry. Very good flavor. My girlfriend tried the Nashville Hot Chicken. We’re from Nashville, so not sure how this one would stand up. It was pretty good, but not like in Nashville. A little too much heat & not enough flavor. Still, she enjoyed it. 

Now for the real reason to try Wynkoop - the beer. I tried two different beers my first day there. First was the Move Your Car Porter. I’m a big fan of porters and stouts, and this lands on my top 10 list for porters. Very smooth and flavorful. Rich, but not too heavy. I really enjoyed this beer. Next I got adventurous and tried the Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout. Believe it or not, this beer has bull testicles in the recipe - no joke. I asked the bartender about it and he told me it was great. He said it has a very smoky flavor. So I tried a 5-oz. sample. Wow, what a pleasant surprise! He was right - smoky, rich flavors. I compared it to Yazoo Sue. I liked it so much, I ordered a full-sized glass with dinner the next day. 

Definitely try the beers, and give the food a shot too. You won’t be disappointed.",Excellent Beer - Very Good Food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d379463-r702007406-Wynkoop_Brewing_Company-Denver_Colorado.html

The place is pretty huge. My boyfriend and I arrived on a Sunday night at around 7 and it wasn’t too busy. It’s self service - you order at the counter, grab a table, and they’ll announce your name over the PA system once your order is ready.

We ordered wings, which were good, and the Rocky Mountain oysters, which I didn’t really like. It didn’t really taste like anything; just fried bits of something weirdly textured/crunchy. I’m still glad I tried it though, because now I’ll never have to order it again. Didn’t seem like anybody else was ordering this though. For my entree, I had the chipotle chicken sammie (charbroiled chicken breast , chipotle pepper, mayo, bacon, pepper - jack cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle on a toasted bun). It wasn’t anything special: just a chicken sammie that was pretty greasy. I did enjoy the curly fries though.

Overall, I think we ordered too much fried food. The sandwiches are already pretty greasy so I feel like you should order something non-fried to balance it out.

The place is owned by four people who started it back in the 80's before the area was known and LoDo, before Coors Field was built and certainly before the restaurant boom in Denver.  And, one of the owners is John Hickenlooper, who until last week was running for President! The old building is awesome, the food is pretty typical pub food with lots of comfort food.  I had the pulled pork sandwich which comes with coleslaw and pickles, on a brioche bun.  It was good and worth the price, but not the best bbq I've had.  They have beer pairings and tastings which is nice. The beers were excellent, we each ordered a variety and tasted among ourselves.  The staff is very friendly.  It was just nice to be in a place that has lasted over the years and is in  what is now a trendy and convenient area.  I recommend stopping by , even for just a beer. Try the pretzel bites, just enough for a late afternoon snack  I wish these guys continued success. p.s. apparently Pres. Obama stopped by  a few years ago and played pool and had a beer.  He liked it so much that he requested that particular brew always be available.  I can't remember the name, but you can ask about it. The joke is that it is always available...for Pres.

I was a little early and the Staff was so friendly and accommodating.  They had a happy hour menu where I was able to order my starter/appetizer.  I had the steak tartar.  It was fabulous.  Good seasoning and good size.  Only small comment would be the duck egg was cute and a novelty, but I like the yoke of an egg to bind the tartar a bit and give it that creaminess.  The duck egg is so small it was more for looks than adding to the flavor. I followed the tartar with traditional escargot, again excellent.  They offer a different presentation but chose the traditional version and I was happy that I did.  Then things started to fall apart.  I had a martini cocktail which I enjoyed, but I trying to cut back on drinking so much and asked for a non-alcoholic beverage, any juice or soft drink would be fine.  I was told they had nothing but water unless I wanted to order a non-alcoholic cocktail from the bar. I paid the extra money for a fruity non-alcoholic cocktail that I didn't really want just to get something non-alcoholic.  I wondered, if the cocktail has fruit juice, why couldn't I have had just the fruit juice. Big strike.
     I had the duck confit or Cassoulet de Canard Confit.  It was extremely dry.  Way over cooked. The dry duck leg was served on very dry breadcrumbs - yes, breadcrumbs.  No sauce at all. Over half the dish was undressed frisee salad.  Huge disappointment.  Surprise! I was able to order black coffee (which is non-alcoholic).  I would have been happy if it was offered earlier as a non-alcoholic beverage.  
  I recently moved up from the Denver Tech Center and the wonderful restaurants around there.  I was looking for a new go-to place for a quiet excellent dinner closer to my new home.  It will not be Bistro Vendome.  I'll keep looking.

I'm also a foodie and respect Jennifer Jasinski whose name is a part of this place.   Anyway, my husband and I went for an early dinner on a Sunday evening, and we appreciated that in their new location in Park Hill, the parking situation is way better than downtown.  I would have loved to sit outside on their patio, but it's located in the front of the restaurant and therefore you get neighborhood noise and street noise, so we opted for indoors.  We were seated at a nice window table and we also had a view of the kitchen which is kind of fun if you're a foodie, until one of the kitchen staff rolled her eyes when our server asked for a substitution on my entree.  Manager, please instruct your staff that people can see them and their facial expressions.  Our server Christopher was very nice and attentive.  I wasn't a fan of him upselling us on the $4 'butter service' talking about how the butter is from Normandy.   My husband is a bread eater, and if you're going to upsell us on a butter service, bring a delicious piece of bread to go with this special butter.  My husband said the bread was mediocre.  Disappointing.  We both ordered salads - chicoree/frisee with chunks of apple and goat cheese for my husband and arugula with macadamia nuts and shallots with a Palisade peach vinaigrette for me.  We both agreed as we drove home that the salads were the most interesting thing we ate  - tasty preparations and well dressed.  The menu is limited, definitely French fare, but not the best we've ever had.  We shared two different entrees - hanger steak frites and grilled pork tenderloin.  A staple of French cooking is sauce work and I'll give it to them because the sauces were very tasty.  But at the end of the day for what we had, we were both underwhelmed by the overall experience.

We have very mixed feelings about our dining experience.  I had booked a table about 3 weeks in advance, online, only to find out that our small table was right in the area of the front counter, and it felt like we were sitting with the people that were coming in to check in, and while they stood waiting they were a part of our sitting area and dining experience - initially super uncomfortable until ""zoned"" them out!!  :(  They need to totally REMOVE THIS TABLE  - the placement of this table is dreadful as a diner and diners paying a good price for their food. They couldn't move us, because they were too busy when we inquired about this.  My recommendation is if you want to sit it a particular area call the restaurant don't book it online and take a chance like we did and end up at the front desk (call them).  Our waiter Howard, however, was excellent, as a server - super friendly and welcoming, and knowledgable of the menu.  However, some of the staff need a little more training.  Even though they were all lovely we were a little surprised when for instance one of the servers refilling our water glasses slopped it all over the table, made a joke of it and felt no need to wipe it up, simply left the water all over the table and walked off.  My husband had the chicken main which he said was very ordinary in appearance and flavor, and I had the trout which was delicious.  Again though we were very surprised by the presentation when it arrived at our table, extremely underwhelming for both in appearance for a restaurant that looks like ""Bistro Vendome"".  Both dishes simply looked like a piece of protein and salad made at home.  The dessert we ordered and shared was delicious - we had the black forest cake.  The Veuve Vernay Brut Rose that I ordered was perfectly chilled and delicious.  So we came away with very mixed feelings about Bistro Vendome which is very disappointing - we really wanted to like it but we came away feeling on the whole that we had a very average experience and by no means will we be rushing back.  For two mains, two drinks and one dessert it cost around $115 before a tip.",Mixed Emotions for Bistro Vendome - Average,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d379530-r891442585-Bistro_Vendome-Denver_Colorado.html

We arrived 20 minutes early on a Saturday evening for our reservation, and were seated promptly as we were the first seating for the dinner round.  We had previewed the menu ahead of time and knew what items were drool worthy so we set out to embark on this culinary experience by ordering everything at once as soon as our very friendly server arrived.  The steak tartare arrived with a side of chips and my wife, who’s eaten many, thought it was one of the best she’s had.  I’m not much into raw meat but I really liked the flavor of the chips. The French onion soup was great with the right amount of toastiness to the bread and an excellent Gruyère covering it all. Not overly salty like you get in some places.   
While waiting for round 2 to arrive we enjoyed the French bread with a sweet creamy butter that brought back memories of our time in the Loire valley.  Then came the Lamb Navarin which is the most expensive item on their menu but well worth the cost.  It was slow cooked and so tender you could cut it with a spoon.  It was topped with a turnip green pistou that gave a very fresh spring flavor to the meat.  We ordered a side of Pommes Frites and were glad we did as it had the most amazing sweet salty flavor you don’t expect in standard fries, as they toss the fries in a mixture of sugar and champagne to apply a nice coating. I wouldn’t advise asking for ketchup as you’ll lose the flavor of this exotic variation of fries.  The bottle of red from Chinon we ordered complemented every course well and I recommend that if you are stuck looking for the right pairing. 
After completing the main meal we were quite full but very content, so when the server brought out the dessert menu we quickly ordered the chocolate soufflé. I mean how could you not?  It said on the menu to give it 20 minutes to come out, which was perfect as that would give us enough time to free up a little space for this final round of gastronomic gluttony, as well as agree that we are definitely coming back here for our anniversary. 
It was during this 20 minute wait that the manager came to our table and curtly told us that they had promised the table to another couple soon, suggesting that we please wrap it up.    Wait, WHAT??  We’ve been eating nonstop since appetizers arrived and now we’re being kicked out as they think we’re just tying up a table for the evening?  He clearly hadn’t done his due diligence and ask our server for a status update on the soufflé first. This was the equivalent of being shaken awake during a wonderful dream.  At that point our entire experience soured so we decided not to spend another minute there, soufflé or not. 

As food and experience are weighted evenly in my reviews, I’d have to give the food 5 stars and the experience negative 1 star, which is a shame as this final rating does not reflect the perfection attained by the chef and wait staff who are really the ones that get all the credit.",Don’t order the chocolate soufflé or…,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d379530-r886414557-Bistro_Vendome-Denver_Colorado.html

When we arrived we had to wait 45 minutes past our scheduled reservation to be seated. We were seated near a large, uncurtained window, on a cold evening, so we had to keep our coats on, in spite of the heater in our corner (which we had to turn on). Food and wine were overpriced and underwhelming. I had the onion tart - the shell was lined with way too much mustard, overpowering the carmelized onion flavor. I also ordered a french garlic soup - it was not very different from a typical french onion soup, but mercifully, less salty than others I've had. My son's steak was chewy, and the duck my parents shared was very fatty and dry. My husband, who has dietary restrictions and couldn't eat most of what was on the menu, ordered a salad and the seafood soup, and left quite hungry. The frites were good, at least. But well over $300 feels like far to much to pay for acceptable french fries.  Try Lucina instead, 2 doors down, for a unique and satisfying dining experience.

I will be the first to admit that French cooking is one of my favorites.  Before dining on Vendome’s almond crusted trout I enjoyed a very well mixed “Manhattan Noir” which was a delightfully smooth bourbon drink.  I coupled that with their warm flavorful French union soup which was not too salty.  

Given the cold I thought it was only appropriate to order a chocolate soufflé and that arrived warm and rich.  The restaurant definitely has a French cafe feel with its design.  More importantly, the staff made the visit and were very welcoming.

They simply melted in your mouth while simultaneously bursting with flavor enhanced by minuscule morsels of minced garlic. Craving satisfied with aplomb!

The main dish of steak frites was cooked to juicy medium-rare perfection as well, with a light-crisp pepper crust accenting Vendome's aupoivre sauce. Every bite provided a rich hit of the steak's essence while not feeling as absurdly filling as other cuts of meat. The fries had such a nice crunch and saltiness to complement and round out the offering. The bistro nails this dish. 

Looking across the entirety of Bistro Vendome from the rear banquette, it's hard not to realize that you're just a narrow corridor away from Denver's storied Larimer Street. Even though a tourist set bustles nearby, there's a genuine ambiance about the dining room that almost feeds more flavor into the staples of French cuisine that adorn the straightforward menu.

The service was slow and the server made errors. The restaurant does not identify gluten free menu items, and although I requested that the lavash crackers be omitted from the cheese plate, that did not happen. The server made us feel unwelcome in the restaurant. 

I went to the restaurant for dinner with a business colleague. We were seated at a small table in a small front room with with a large window to my right and a wall of wine bottles behind me. There there were no other customers in the room. We had to move the two-person table a bit closer to the wall to make room to sit down. During the meal, the waiter came to get a bottle of wine from the wall, and I asked how he could get the bottles near the top. He said he usually stood on a chair. Since my chair was the closest to the wall, that seemed to mean that he usually stood on the chair that I was sitting on. At the end of the meal, a few minutes before we were ready to leave, the waiter asked us to move to an adjacent table that had been empty during our entire stay at the restaurant. 

When ordering the cheese plate, I explained to the server that I have a wheat allergy and didn't want the lavash crackers, and he seemed to understand, because he advised me not to order the chickpea fries, due to cross contamination in the frying oil. However, when the plate came, the crackers were on it, and half of the plate was covered with wheat crumbs. While the cheese itself was good, I was not able to enjoy it while worrying about wheat contamination. The vegetarian salad I ordered was edible, but not memorable, and unlike the high quality vegetables that I have eaten at more casual restaurants in Denver.","Poor choice for gluten free or vegetarian, unfriendly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d379530-r739471195-Bistro_Vendome-Denver_Colorado.html

For one person in our party, who has a severe gluten allergy, the dinner was a disaster. She told the waiter that she was celiac, and despite assurances that the items she ordered were indeed gluten-free, she experienced a severe reaction to her meal 10 minutes after leaving the restaurant. This morning, the manager promptly returned our voicemail from last night, and while courteous and reassured us that all of the items were indeed gluten-free, she repeatedly remarked that they are not a celiac kitchen and it must be cross-contamination. Being a French restaurant, she remarked, they used a lot more gluten-based products than most restaurants (e.g. baguettes). We spent weeks this past summer in France and Italy and never had an issue. My conclusion, if you don't have a gluten/celiac issue, you'll have a marvelous dining experience; if you do have a gluten/celiac issue, I'd stay away. As an aside, the manager never offered to compensate the one person's meal or make any other efforts beyond stating ""we are not a celiac kitchen.""",Not for Celiacs!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d379530-r735348070-Bistro_Vendome-Denver_Colorado.html

The setting is great, in a courtyard well off busy Larimer Street, and with a nice terrace that must be nice when the weather is good.  The weather was very cold when we went, so the warm tones inside set the right mood for the poor weather outside.
I tried the escargots, and my wife and I split orders of sauteed scallops and steak frites.
The food was excellent overall, although the escargots were not served piping hot, as I like them.  The scallops were tender and perfectly cooked, and the steak likewise so. The service was excellent.
The wine list is good, and we chose a Corbieres, not seen too often on US wine lists – it was good, and though pricey compared to getting the same in France, it’s fair to say that it very hard to get a good deal on a decent wine in a US restaurant.
The atmosphere was one of low conversations and subdued light, but not dim.  Pleasant and a good setting for a conversation at the table, not too loud to hear everyone.  The décor is well- done and fitting the bistro theme.

However, we were most disappointed in the food...both entrees were overly salted--ruined the flavors of the duck and the scallops, outweighing everything else.  The portion of the scallops entree was minimal and they were small scallops.  The duck portion (leg /thigh) was fine but again salty. The escargot appetizer was also disappointing.  The dessert offered as 'chocolate souffle' was not at all a souffle; it was more like one of those hot lava chocolate cakes in a cup----nothing at all of the texture or definition of a smooth, light & airy souffle.  Because of the quality of the food, I felt that everything was overpriced, even during restaurant week!
Our waiter was attentive, friendly, perfectly timed, and cognizant of our time since we were attending the theater afterwards although we were not in any rush.

Here is a quick summary:
1.  The restaurant is hidden in a courtyard off Larimer Street, which has some charm.  It is immediately across the street from Rioja, its sister restaurant.  
2.  If you are driving you can pull up to Rioja for valet parking ($10 plus tip) and just walk across the street which is very convenient.
3.  The restaurant is owned by Chef Jennifer Jasinski- winner of the 2013 James Beard  Best Chef Southwest Award and a semi-finalist for the 216 James Beard Best Chef Award.
4.  The restaurant has great ambiance in the bar, main dining area and the patio.  As you would find in a Parisian bistro, the tables are closely packed together.
5.  The dress code, like many Denver area restaurants, is relaxed with most diners being casual (three of our four diners wore jeans) to business casual with scattered diners being smartly dressed.
5.  While the restaurant has Parisian influences, it is not a classic Parisian menu and many ""foodie purists"" expecting an exact replica of Parisian food will be disappointed.  This is reflected in a number of reviews where diners are disappointed that the menu does not reflect their dining experience in Paris.
6.  The menu is divided into Hors D'Oeuvres that includes a daily cheese board, Primary Plates, Steak Frites, Salads, Small Plates and Desserts.  On this evening our party had the onion soup (excellent), Crepe Vendome (excellent), duck confit (very good), scallops (very good), steak frites (excellent) and creme brulee (excellent).  For those that have not tried the unusual take on their French fries, I would strongly recommend them- in my opinion they are excellent.
7.  Service was excellent and friendly- certainly better than anything that we experienced in three trips to Paris (I also lived there for four years).
8.  While I highly recommend this restaurant, I have two caveats that you need to take into account before dining here.  First as other reviews have reported, the portions are not large- do not expect a giant slab of beef or lamb as most Americans are used to.  However, many will find the portions adequate if you have an appetizer or salad course, main course and a dessert.  Second, in my opinion some of the items are slightly oversalted.  This is of course a matter of opinion and some will find the salt levels suited to their taste.",French food with Rocky Mountain influences,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d379530-r638029039-Bistro_Vendome-Denver_Colorado.html

Ambience, food and service were all at the same high level. The moules, as well as the beet and date salad were very fine starters, the former in a light, not too garlicky broth while the latter was nicely proportioned and perfectly dressed. The duck confit was just as it should be -- falling off the bone tender and well seasoned. Its accompaniments, which included turnips three ways, were welcome pairings. The steak frites (au poivre in our case) was a simple affair, just as it should be, and done to a turn.  The potatoes were crisp, salty and plentifull. The wine, recommended by our server, was an excellent choice (though I can't recall what it was).

The pluses: Great steak frites, delicious creme brûlée and other desserts. Reasonable wine list. Nice ambience with the lights and shops on Larimer street. The minuses: $28+ for one lamb chop. That made quite an impression on our guests, especially in comparison to the lower priced steak frites. As one put it, in the most English sort of way, they didn't realize there were so many dieting supermodels dining in Denver these days. 

Second minus: waitress was a stickler for glass of wine pricing at end of happy hour while we were waiting for our table, and shortly thereafter after we had been seated and prices were much higher. Right call would have been to suggest ordering a bottle at the happy hour price. But she stayed silent about that.  Our guests felt like they had been hustled, which detracted from their opinion of Vendome. Staff at world class restaurants don't behave this way.

Bottom line: This is a local Denver restaurant we had hoped would impress our guests from some of the worlds' top restaurant cities. On balance, it sadly fell short. Expensive and in too many ways, disappointing. We won't make this mistake again.",Wonderful Hits and Frustrating Misses,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33388-d379530-r635297317-Bistro_Vendome-Denver_Colorado.html

The service was extremely poor...awful might be a better word.  Our party of four was seated at one of the only three occupied tables which should have been my first clue since this was a Saturday night and only two other tables had customers.  Not once during the entire meal did the waitress stop by to check on us after taking our order.  I finally took the empty glasses to the bar for refills myself.  When I spoke to the manager, she said that was unacceptable, but yet did NOTHING to address the problem.   The bill was slightly over $100 for four adults and that did not include alcoholic beverages which is an expensive dinner for Guymon.  Do NOT waste your money on this place - it is so NOT worth it.  PS - Avoid the Chocolate Bananna Bread Pudding.  It was so salty that two of us literally had to spit it out.  Overall, a ""wannabe"" resturant that does NOT have the food or service to justify such expensive meals.",Do NOT eat here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51390-d1759902-r69700411-The_Pub_On_The_Bricks-Guymon_Oklahoma.html
