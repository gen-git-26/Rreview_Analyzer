My sister sent me gift cards to what I thought was BJ wholesale club but unfortunately it was the wrong BJ’s this was a restaurant at Green Acres Mall.  So I told her we have to go and see what it’s like and use my gift cards.

What a wonderful food Surprise.

The restaurant is of a substantial size and very nice done. 
The menu is extensive and we tried many things.
For appetizers we had 
French Onion soup in the bread bowl- excellent 
Meatballs - good
Spicy Buffalo Wings - excellent 
Broccoli and Cheddar soup - excellent 
Crispy Flatbread Nachos - excellent 

Entrees:

BBQ RIbs with mashed potatoes, the ribs where so good the meat fell off the bone.- excellent 
Honey Crisp Chicken Salad was of a very good size and was good.
Salmon with vegetables was good 
Chicken Caesar Salad was good 

This restaurant surprised us with how good the food was but the service and drinks was not to standard.
The drinks where watered down and we had to return one because we ordered 2 of the same drink and you can see the lack of consistency from the bartender on the drinks.
Our waitress was very aloof and laid back our appetizers arrived and we still didn’t have silverware or water which we had already asked for.  We ended up asking another waiter that was walking by for the silverware and water. It seems like the waitress continued to forget about us and this was on a Monday afternoon, when there were only maybe 4 other tables to serve, and not even by her.

We were very happy to see one in this area. We ordered 6 order of #8Matcha Azuki Bean. We were very disappointed!!. We got our order one at the time, since they had to freshly make the crepe, which btw were not crispy as it should had been. After the 1st order came out, the crepe got smaller and smaller, as well as the size of the matcha ice cream. Not to mention that the last order the ice cream was practically melted away. We like #8 a lot, because of the matcha ice cream, since they didn't put enough of it, or even melted, it didn't taste as good as the one we had in Philadelphia. Even though this location is closer to us, we'll not stop by again. It's not cheap, $7.95 plus tax, it would be OK as long as it tastes good.",DISAPPOINTED!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g47729-d8846013-r353964874-T_Swirl_Crepe-Flushing_Queens_New_York.html

This time was not a good one.. my waitress seemed to forget about me and I was left waiting for a beer and also some silverwear.  She didn't come back and ask how things were and I had to ask again for silverwear.. Thus time I got some but the napkin was wet... The pan pizza was more bread than pizza and I asked for extra cheese..i would hate to see the amount of regular cheese...i had to squint to find it.

Seasoned very well, no MSG! Food temperatures was well. The ambiance of the restaurant was welcoming. Our problem with this very nice restaurant is the SERVICE!  It was non existent!!!  After 20 mins of waiting after we were seated, finally a waitress came over. Asked did anyone come to us yet and we said no. She had to check because she thinks it's someone else's table. Another 5 mins and she said your server will be with you shortly.  10 mins later, she wound up taking the order. We had to ask for just about everything. But, she was very pleasant and apologetic about the service. And at the end, we had to wait over 20 mins just to pay the bill! Wow!!!

My family and I went to this fairly new restaurant on a Wednesday night.  The place was less than half full.  It took about five minutes for our waitress to greet us.  She took our drink and app. order.  The drinks came quickly but were wrong.  We did not see her again till after our main course was served which was also wrong.  Our drinks were empty but we were not asked if we would like refills.  We could see our waitress standing and chatting at the other side of the restaurant but we could not get her attention.  We finished our meal and waited along time for her to come over to take desert orders.  We then waited along time for her to come back so we could ask for the check.

The restaurant was fairly empty. The waiter came over eventually and took our drink orders. He finally returned with the drinks and at that time we advised him that we wanted to place our orders. He stated he will be back in a few. He did return, but not in a few, he took the orders and it took forever for us to receive our meal. We were not the only one of his tables who were visibly upset. When I left I did not see the manager or I would have made my complaint at that time. 
I was ready to leave after sitting there for over 45 minutes.The food eventually came out at 7:20pm. Over 45 minutes for a party of 4 with nothing extravagant in the orders. We ordered dessert against my better judgement but they were having an awesome sale. Even though it took the food so long to come out of the kitchen we would have been at ease if the waiter was more attentive. He had certain tables he stayed at talking about the football game. We had to continually call him over for anything we wanted. Ex: refills, napkins, dessert.
We were in the restaurant for over 2 hours and that did not include waiting to be seated, just for food service. The food is great but the waitstaff needs more or better training.

The soup was piping hot! The Caesar salad was tasty. What I didn't know is that it was unlimited. Next I had a bowl of tomato bisque which I think enjoyed more than the chowder. I was then able to take a large serving of bisque home and another salad which my daughter will have for dinner tonight. The hubby wanted to try the monkey bread beignet. Too sweet for me.

He chose Randolph’s and we found the place pretty much empty on a weekday at lunchtime so we could seat ourselves anywhere we wanted. There’s a lot of “benchy” wooden seating and we easily found a comfortable place. There’s a really nice selection of craft beers available on draft and some are made right at Randolph’s.  Three of us chose an IPA made there and IMHO and those of my friends, too, it was excellent for sure.  One thing that was unsettling to each and every one of us was the very apparent curt and condescending attitude of the bartender, to whom all orders were placed.  Please trust me when I say we presented no problems and simply wanted to place our beer and food orders.  It was only after I asked her if we were somehow troubling her and assured me that we were not that she then acted courteously and without the attitude. I suppose we all can have “off moments,” so it wasn’t the end of the world. But most importantly I want to mention that not only the beer was excellent...the food was, too.  The menu is extensive for a brewery/pub establishment and the offerings appeared to be interesting, varied and appealing. A number of different dishes were ordered among us and everyone enjoyed their food.  The portions were nice-sized and very appealing to the eye when brought out to our table. All in all, I’d say that this very casual place is a nice choice for a very casual meal that will provide very satisfying drink and food.",I did like it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60827-d13415078-r665703576-Randolph_Beer-Brooklyn_New_York.html

My younger son grew up on E. 22nd St. & Ave. P just off Kings Highway. To stroll on the Highway and enjoy the many fruit and vegetable stores and all the wonderful shops has always been a pleasure. I find the area colorful, lively, and convenient. The bagel shop near Ocean Ave. has everything you could want in a bagel shop, the Turkish restaurant on Kings Highway & E. 19th has very tasty food, there's a huge Russian shop with all kinds of delicacies across from the restaurant. I used to frequent Minerva Diner years back and was sorry when it closed. There was a health food store near the Kings Highway train station, but that also closed years back. I often shop at a discount store corner of 18th Street and a home decor and appliance store on same block. Big Banana is great for both produce and supermarket fare. Kings Highway Bakery is a wonderful bakery. I love the Amazon Cafe off Kings Highway on E. 12th St. There are numerous 99 cent shops along Kings Highway. I went to an acupuncture and herbal doctor  over where Adelmans used to be and they helped a great deal with my arthritis and allergy problems. My mom (who lived in New Jersey towards the end of her years) loved coming into Brooklyn for our family reunion at Adelmans; we all loved Adelmans. The food was wonderful - the soups, the corn beef sandwiches, the liver & peppers & onions - all their food was great. Very sorry when they closed down. I loved walking with my kids on Kings Highway and doing my shopping there. It's one of those old fashioned neighborhoods, somewhat international, with many ethnic restaurants, including Japanese restaurants, & also a great mix of people which I love, where you can still get plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, enjoy fine pastries at the Kings Highway Bakery & generally enjoy a lively and fun (& convenient) experience.",Kings Highway area - Great to Walk - Great to Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60827-d5088995-r504442637-Kings_Highway_Bakery-Brooklyn_New_York.html

Lo primero que llama la atención del lugar son los enormes depósitos de cervezas situado en la entrada, ya hacen presagiar que estamos en un bar distinto. Lo segundo que nos sorprende son los 20 tiradores localizados en una pared del bar bajo el título “beer yourself” y es aquí donde se encuentra la esencia del lugar. En la barra te proporcionan una tarjeta personal con la que podrás ir llenando tu copa con la cerveza y la cantidad que desees. Cada tirador tiene un contador que irá sumando dinero gastado en tu tarjeta en función del uso. El mecanismo me pareció grandioso, ya que deja total autonomía a los clientes para elegir el tipo y la cantidad de cerveza que quiere tomar, dándole opción de probar multitud de cervezas.

Respecto a la comida, el restaurante destaca por el uso de materia prima de calidad y productos frescos. Nosotros optamos por una hamburguesa con queso, la cual estaba exquisita, acompañada con una guarnición de patatas fritas caseras aderezadas con unas especias, dándoles o toque picante buenísimo. Casi podría decir que han sido las mejores papas fritas que he comido en la ciudad de New York.

El precio va en sintonía con los que encuentras en la ciudad, es adecuado para la calidad y servicio que ofrece, además lógicamente va en función de las cervezas consumidas. Yo acudí con mi pareja, pedimos dos hamburguesas con su guarnición de papas y aproximadamente 4 copas de cervezas, nos costó todo 60$.

From the exterior to the inside decor you could be forgiven for thinking you were in 1960s Montmartre rather than urban Bushwick. If only such attention was extended to their menu and service. 

The first surprise came when our ""waiter"" finally deigned to bring our menus. Rather than the Gallic cuisine one would expect it seemed to be a hotch-potch of Italian dishes and American truck-stop fare with a few obvious French staples thrown in for good measure. I don't think I've seen Coq Au Vin on a menu since the 1970s! Also, the starter we wanted to order was off the menu. 

We settled on a portion of oysters, which to their credit, were beautifully served on a generous bed of ice with lemon, accompanied by the customary dish of wine vinegar. All good so far until... Ugghhh!! What on earth is that red substance in the other 'petit bol' ? Tomato sauce!!  After the arduous task of catching the waiter's eye I asked if they didn't have any Mignonette or at least Tabasco as one would expect. The response was a haughty negative with no alternative offered. Though given the establishment's ""idiosyncratic"" understanding of how to serve oysters I was half expecting he'd suggest peanut butter. 

Not perhaps the most auspicious start to a meal but at least the lighting was nice and the Sauvignon Blanc crisp and zesty. 

Then the mains. After telling the waiter we were both vegetarian and ordering the housemade pasta, sans merguez sausage, it was a bit of a disappointment this hadn't been conveyed to the chef and my dish arrived full of pork. 

Again, my retina got a good work-out trying to attract the waiter's attention. Once I made my grievance clear and reiterated that we had told him we were both vegetarian and requested meat-free dishes - which in my understanding generally includes pork sausage - he picked up my plate and actually quipped ""OK, i'll pick the meat out then, shall I?"" Incredulous for a second, I then responded ""What did you say?"" But his back was turned as he entered the kitchen. 

If I wasn't with such delightful company and wishing to salvage the rest of the dinner it would have been his teeth he was picking out of the bowl. 

Once returned - sausage free - the dish was pleasant enough, albeit with the 'al dente' ratio perhaps inverted between the pasta and vegetables. My companion's dish was of a similar standard: palatable enough, but nothing remarkable. 

To conclude, I do not think I have ever encountered such obnoxious, unprofessional staff working in a restaurant, and I have encountered my fair share of bad service in thirty years of dining out. One would think at the prices they are charging ($116 for food of the standard one might expect from one of the tourist-trap bistros on Pigalle) they would be grateful for all the custom they got and treat diners with the courtesy they deserve. Evidently not. 

I wouldn't eat here again if I was awaiting execution on Death Row and this was offered as my last meal.","Mediocre food, arrogant staff",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60827-d4600570-r270702696-Mominette-Brooklyn_New_York.html

Mominette stands out – not in frontage but in quality – and their outdoor space at the back is delightful. The spinach & goat cheese croissant ($10) is a crowd favourite, and the French toast ($9) is colourful. The Sunday special oyster Benedict was wonderful, with the shellfish deep fried and placed on sturdy poached eggs and English muffins. I also had a tasty beets’n’bourbon cocktail that was begging for some ice and a taller glass. Though it can be expensive, service is great, and the kitchen is quick to fulfill orders at busy periods.
This restaurant will surely go down as one of the forerunners in Bushwick’s blossoming.

Food- Really great quality American food. Highly recommend the steak baguette, crispy chicken sandwich, old bay fries,  and any of the appetizers and bowls. They also have a solid selection of craft beers and wine, and pre-pandemic the brunch/breakfast options were incredible as well!

The manager Mr. Jeevan (don’t know if its his genuine name), argues that there is no booking for us. Then we show the confirmation at Open Table app, wherein he realises that they have given our table to some other guests. We had to argue for 10 mins, but they still denied us saying that those other guests said my name as their’s, so they had to give them the table. But eventually, the truth was that those were regular customers, so they thought Open Table bookings are of no value, and they should allot the table to their regular customers first. 
After 10 mins of argument, and shouting’s, they finally agreed to their mistake, but we had to wait for another 25 mins to get our table set. 

Then we very politely request the manager to give us some discount or other incentives owing to their blunder mistake, but the manager acted and behaved in a very rude manner with us, and said that ‘Go write on Trip Advisor, I don’t care!’  

I truly believe this was the worst ever restaurant experience I ever had in New York City. It was my first and last visit. We were a group of 14 people, I am certain none of us is even moderately satisfied with the kind of service and hospitality shown. 

Their manager is super rude, their reservation system is totally broken, the food is very average, and expensive.  This kind is service and behaviour can not be expected from a reputed restaurant in New York City. They need to understand that being rude to their genuine customers is the last thing they should wish for. I am highly disappointed with them, and so are by business guests from Vietnam. I highly regret my decision of inviting my guests here for dinner. Such mental agony and embarrassment.

I had varied meals here and I find the food quite tasty and nicely seasoned.Last time I went with a party of 7 and all ordered variety of vegetarian dishes and everyone like this place.
Only thing is that they have a large beer list but only seems to carry 2 may be. I ordered one from the menu. They didn't have it, pushed for Taj Mahal. I didn't want that, so I asked for another one from the menu. The server didn't say that they don't have it but came back after 15 mins and asks me "" Do you like Blue Moon?"" Now, I knew that is the only thing probably they have other than Taj Mahal. So, I said yes and had my beer after all.
That is minor annoyance and for a popular restaurant like this, they should at least cross them out with a sharpie ot get a new menu.",A good place in curry hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1367951-r693874264-Dhaba-New_York_City_New_York.html

The restaurant is small and the decor is not much. The tables were turned with some regularity despite being at capacity because the service is rapid. The food was good, although nothing is standing out as a not-to-be-missed dish.  The spices were not overpowering and the flavor of the fresh vegetables came through. They had an appetizer with cubes of grilled paneer,  which was something that I had not seen in an Indian restaurant before.  They were tasty, but the taste was only on the outside and the inside was a bit bland, as paneer tends to be anyway.  Marinating would have cured this issue. 

There was a high level of noise (as there seems to be in a lot of NYC restaurants).  I personally do not like to have to yell to be heard.

All in all, it was a pleasant evening with good food and not much conversation.","Good Indian, If You Can Tolerate Noise",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1367951-r503359507-Dhaba-New_York_City_New_York.html

We tried the paneer, daal makhani and naan. The service was super slow and we had to repeatedly ask for our food even post 30 minutes of order.

We were seated promptly, order taken quickly and some splendid bread and olives came quickly. We could see fresh bread being baked so things were looking good. Mezze came quickly and mains were timely too..

But after that service ground to a halt. I suspect the reason was a lot of customers asking for explanations of the dishes, but simply taking a coffee order and delivering coffee took an age (the regular coffee is $2.50 and not great value at that price).

We came with 6 people, and were seated right away, but it got full fast and I would suggest reservations.

Oh my gosh the food!  They started us off with soft, crispy flatbread from right out of the oven, with a strong fruity olive oil at the table.  We had an assortment of fantastic appetizers-- our favorite was a dish of dumplings in a seasoned yogurt (think tzadziki) sauce that was ridiculously good.

My entree was a moussaka, nothing like the Greek casserole-y dish I'm used to, but a very elegant single plate dish with layers of eggplant and other amazing stuff.  I got to taste my brother-in-law's fish tagine, which was amazing, with dried fruits and citrus, something incredibly unique and tasty. My sister had a dish with chunks of grilled lamb on a bed of smoky eggplant purée, similar to baba ganouj.  Also excellent.

The desserts were just insanely good -- out-of-this-world baklava with vanilla ice cream, and a baked milk pudding dish I've never had before but was truly life-changing.  

The service was fantastic-- warm, friendly... when we complimented the food (which we did a lot), they would light up, like you made their day.

Took a walk on Amsterdam to see what looked interesting and ended up outside this bustling Turkish restaurant and found the last table providing I promised to be finished in 45 minutes as there was a reservation for it 
I said no problem as I was solo
It started great was given some delicious home made bread light crispy charged from being made right in front of me in the wood fired oven and served with olive oil and black olives
I asked my server to recommend her favorite dish and house specialty as I was exhausted and didn’t want to read the whole menu
She promptly said the lamb tagine and I went along
How disappointed I was ,it was bland and came with pieces of over cooked zucchini a few carrots and peas and red peppers ,it just seemed like boiled pieces of lamb,no depth of flavor and why would I order lamb tagine ,no flipping idea as the previous night have a small plate of lamb tagine at Alta which was incredible,that’s what happens when you are to tired to read the menu 
I was still a little hungry and decided to have the oven baked rice pudding with vanilla gelato

This is a solid choice for trying some classic dishes, from Moussaka & Baklava (Greek) to classic Turkish - from sigara borek to Kebabs - with common dishes (Mediterranean salads, eggplant & yoghurt dishes, etc.) in between.

Following review advice, we'd hoped for a table outside but after a 20 minute or so wait, on a warm end-of-summer evening, we got put along the wall, inside, near the open window. A little tight, but not too bad. A little more hectic than outdoors, less street view but a view of the blazing brick oven. 

We tried several appetizers and main courses - desserts too - and everything was very good, no complaints about entrees or appetizers (or the delicious desserts).  We had raki with our meal, as is the custom, and we were happy they had it.  However - and this is the reason I could never give 5 stars - we were absolutely astonished, all of us, that this restaurant does not serve ayran, the ""national drink"" of Turkey and easily available at other restaurants in NY. Thus I cannot recommend this as heartily as Sevens or other West Side Turkish restaurants which of course do serve Ayran. Can't fathom why Bodrum does not.

That said, the appetizers were pretty, well-prepared, and tasty. So too were the main courses. While the brick oven and their page of pizza choices are clearly a big draw to this restaurant, we went with classic favorites, mostly Turkish, a few really Greek, or regional. Yes, they are authentic in capturing the classics and have a nice touch with the presentation. (We failed to get one of the things we ordered, as it was very busy and apparently we'd overloaded the friendly but very mobile waitress.)  

We got salads and an appetizer of Manti - dumplings with lamb, herbs & garlic yogurt -and entrees of Lamb Tagine (they also serve ""Pirzola Colorado lamb"", whatever that is), along with various Kebobs - all good. Desserts were great, as was the khava/coffee. 

So, in sum, Bodrum offers a wide variety of both ""classic"" and modern/Westernized Turkish cuisine, with Greek and other Mediterranean standards, along with their brick oven ""Turkish Pizza"" offerings. On a nice day or eve, the outside tables are pleasant for the breeze and taking in street scenes and passersby. It does get busy at dinner time.

Solid offering in the Upper West Side. But... bring your own ayran.","Eclectic, cozy, Med-Pizza and More",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d734882-r529182982-Bodrum-New_York_City_New_York.html

Glad we did.  Large menu, with dishes both familiar and not so much.  Small but stylish space, comfortable, a little dark and a little loud.  Service was good; the food came out quick.  Delicious, large portions, as spicy as you'd want it.  The only (minor) disappointment was the onion naan, which didn't have much flavor.  Prices are fair and reasonable. I will definitely return, although I'd probably also try some of the surrounding places to compare.

We started with warm tasty bread that we dipped in olive oil. We then shared crispy calamari which was also very good.

I describe the lamb dish as a deconstructed lamb meatball that may be the ""best meatball sub ever"". It was tender, seasoned beautifully, and had some of the best red sauce I've ever tasted. 

Our server was Nina. She was very lovely and attentive. She really cared about our experience and how much we enjoyed their food.",Deliciousness!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d734882-r377456668-Bodrum-New_York_City_New_York.html

I've eaten turkish food in Turkey, Germany, France and my mothers turkish food.

In Turkey not alot of things beat your mothers cooking. It's almost sacred in a way. 
This expression applies to all oriental countries and probably alot of other countries aswell.
When I had dinner at Bodrum in 2013 (sorry for the long wait before the review) with my GF, we ordered in most of the classical dishes I remember from my childhood.
All of them were excellent, some even BETTER than my mothers version.
The seasoning was spot on, the spices used were exemplary for the choice of food and all done in accordance to tradition.
They had great service, great cookery, great selection of wines and beer(Note: I collect rare beers and wines. I can attest to the quality they purchase since I work with wine everyday at a winemerchant).
Of course restaurants have bad days and you might not experience what I did. Consistency of quality is of course a key factor in  every restaurant.
Therefor i recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in the neighborhood and that wants to try out an authentic turkish restaurant.

That distinction  is not often made on American menus for most of the time. At Bodrum they make that distinction and call it ""Classic Panino"", which is appropriate. Now the question becomes, is it a classic Italian or Turkish panino and will they use focaccia or ciabatta bread and what will the flavors be like? The classic Italian one is with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and basil, olive oil. The Turkish version from the menu is the same or is it? Served on fluffy homemade warm bread, no indication which kind of bread, it turns out to be simply delicious with some unique flavors for such a simple dish. Every dish coming out of the kitchen looked simple, delicious and healthy as the aromas wavered through the establishment. This place is cozy, service quick and professional.

This restaurant is situated in Lexington avenue along with tons of other Indian restaurants to choose from. This restaurant is quiet popular here, the service was good & the ambience added to the vibe. 

Like in India, you get a small plate of free papad, the same was given here too. The delhi style papdi chat was nice & diff than Mumbai or delhi. The paneer makhani & dal tadka were decent too & were served with a salad. 

Though rate wise was steep like paneer makhanwala was about $16 and dal around the same rate. The chaat was around $ 8-9 too. Tips which are a part of the New York culture & thankfully this place didn't mention how much minimum tip was to be left & we could leave as much as we liked.

In addition to a simple buffet of about 8 dishes, they bring naan, an appetizer, and tandoori chicken to your table. They lay out the naan and appetizer on the table and then serve you the chicken after you sit down. I really like this sort of personalized version of the all too boring Indian lunch buffet. Kudos to them. The servers were all pleasant and helpful. None of the dishes were spicy so if you want that, you'll have to load up on the chutneys to spice it up yourself. The place had a nice vibe and buzz within 15 mins of opening. It had good decor and wasn't in need of an update like many Indian establishments tend to be these days.

Then it went wrong. After this exchange which was friendly on both parties. He server didn't want to come back to take our order. We were left to try and get the attention of other servers. 20 minutes later our original server came and took our order.

After this he did not return and tried to avoid us. We could not understand why. Eventually this left a bitter taste.

When the cheque finally came. We decided not to leave a tip as we thought the service was so poor. He stormed over to our table and demanded to know why we have not given a tip. I explained. He stormed off in a huff without saying another word.

We decided to try an alternative in the high 20's/Lex when meeting a friend who lives uptown.  We selected Dhaba because it has an interesting selection of reviews which mostly rate the food highly (but the service not so).

I made a res through Open Table which was a really good thing because the place was packed at 8pm on a winter Wed night.  They did indeed have our reservation and we were seated immediately.  The resaurant, with the usual 3 columns of tables/booths, is comfortably decorated in warm colors.  The menu is quite large with indications of dishes they consider spicy and those chosen as house favorites.  Regular mugs of beer are $6. giant mugs $10 and they offer the usual Kingfisher as well as a Sri Lankan brew and Harpoon IPA -- all for the same price.  There are also wines and cocktails.

We had 2 appetizers.  The aloo tikki chat (potato patties with chickpeas) flavors were a bit muddy but the yogurt sauce was really good.  The paneer taash kabobs (grilled bricks of paneer without the ""shish""which means stick) however were charred and very tasty.  2 breads -- a giant steaming poori and good, but not great, garlic naan.  The naan could have been more garlicky and more charred around the edges for flavor.

Mains:  Sadly the saag paneer was characterless.  This is one of my favorite dishes and I expected more.  Bindi gosht (lamb and okra) was very good but not spicy at all (even though indicated as spicy on the menu).  Malai marke butter murgh had a great silky sauce but the chicken itself was a little overcooked.  This was also far less spicy than expected since it was also indicated as so on the menu.

I think the prices are pretty high but this is the cost of uptown Indian food.  Appetizers are $7-10 and mains $14 +.  Breads are $4-5 and plain rice $3.50.  With mains so high a single dish of rice really should be supplied to the table.  We did not order daal but $12 seems awfully expensive for a plate of lentils. We may have ordered a little too much food, but for 3 of us including 2 beers, the bill was $100.  We did not have dessert.

A lot of reviews complain about the service.  Our service was friendly and nicely attentive.  Absolutely no complaints here on that.

Honestly, the food has real potential but the chef needs to be much more liberal in making the dishes both flavorful and spicy.  Portions are fair.  I think some people misunderstand that the pots that the food is served in means that the portions are small.  If the contents of the pot was spilled into a bowl and served, there would be fewer complaints.  But the pots keep the food warmer longer and are suited for saucy dishes.  Dishes with meat in them had a good amount of meat included.  I was disappointed that there were not many goat entrees available, and that the only one (a goat curry) is $20.",Pleasant 'Curry Hill' Choice - 3+ Rating,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1367951-r253855429-Dhaba-New_York_City_New_York.html

We started with the sampling plate, and a melted cheese plate, which were brought with spears of crusty bread. The sampler was mostly things that you dip into, so another time I would ask also for flat bread, and for my own needs if there was a gluten-free alternative dipper.  

For entrees, we ordered Lamb tagine, braised lamb shank, and wood-oven roasted half chicken.  All were delicious.  The chicken was the larger plate, ideal for my tall SIL.  I had about a third of my tagine cartoned, as I was satisfied and full, and it was good cold on the airplane the next day. 

The service was perfect, attentive but unobtrusive.  I established that the young man hanging out near our table was there waiting for our order.  He was not chatting or being obnoxious, I just had to ask him if he was our waiter.  He was very sweet.  

We are accustomed, in our trips to New York, for many of the restaurants to have small tables closely packed.  This was the case here, though not nearly as tightly packed as some places.  We had ample space to eat and talk, but I tucked the carton on my lap when our dessert came. We shared a molten chocolate cake, and something else, perhaps cheesecake.  They simply put a birthday candle in the chocolate cake for hubby's birthday, which was as he likes to celebrate in a restaurant, not too much fuss.  

We were happily surprised with the prices, not one of our entrees was over $20.  We are used to paying more for a sit-down restaurant in NYC.  We would definitely come here again.  There were some people at another table, who told us they needed to come here to be comforted following Hurricane Sandy, though getting there was more challenge than usual for them as the subway was out.  As the food was delicious, I can see why they would choose this restaurant for rest and comfort.",Delightful Turkish Mediterranean!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d734882-r145316320-Bodrum-New_York_City_New_York.html

We didn't have an appetiser and both chose the Beyti Kebab which was not a huge portion but was really very good. I have to say that although we didn't try them that the pizzas also looked very good and the brick oven gave the place a warm atmosphere on a chilly evening.
The service was very attentive and the Turkish flat bread was yummy!
There was a pretty good wine list and a tried a nice white rioja which was just the job.
To finish off I tried the baklava which was good and husband had ice cream - he said that he thought the vanilla ice cream was over sweet - but that it being really picky!

My girl got the Turkish scrambled eggs with feta, dill, tomatoes, scallions, and grilled pita, and I got the Yesil Salad which has lettuce, black olives, dill, scallions, cucumbers and feta with a lemon vinaigrette.

The most disappointing part was the eggs. About 3 bites in my girl got a crunch; yep...a big piece of egg shell. She searched around a bit and found a few more pieces as well. Rather revolting. Additionally, based on the menu description, we thought the vegetables would be mixed into the eggs, but it was all placed on top like a small salad. The raw scallions and were a bit overpowering in my opinion and would have probably benefited from being cooked a bit with the egg mixture. Just a personal preference I suppose.

As for my salad, it was a real yawner. The lettuce was limp and old, the vinagrette was weak and they put just a few crumbs of feta on top. It just wasn't interesting to eat.

Bodrum has that awesome brick oven inside, so their baked stuff is usually great. But in the few times we've gone, everything else has been really hit and miss, including the service.

It seems there is more than one location, we went to the one close to central park.
W had a bottle of wine, moussaka, pizza and dessert to go(since we were kind of full) - all told $57 before tip.

I really liked the moussaka, a different style of presentation - lots of eggplant, no potatoes - i think its the best moussaka i've had, but perhaps people that know turkish food would have different opinions.  My husband liked his pizza.  I do remember that the bread was really tasty.  Apparently they get it from some turkish bakery every day, i think we have two lots of it.

Bodrum Restaurant opened in June 2007 after renovations at the sites of a former poodle grooming salon, a dry cleaner and a Russian chicken restaurant. As most Manhattanites were away for summer holiday, Bodrum is just being discovered. By the way, 'Bodrum'  is the name is a Turkish town popular with summer tourists.

We shared a fine mushroom soup bordering on a creme soup, very very fine. We shared a 'Mezze', which is a sampling of mediterranean specialties, including hummus, babaghanoush, Turkish eggplant, Moroccan spicy chicken, Turkish fillo stuffed with French Feta, and yougurt cheese mixed with walnuts.

Our waiter was quiet friendly, and quite Turkish. The service, water glasses, bread, blue cloth napkins, and metal silverware spoke of a caliber of restaurant far beyond what would expect to find in the 'moderate' price range.

The restaurant offers Turkish and Swordfish kebab and a variety of fish served both American and Moroccan style, as well as a selection of regular or whole wheat pizza pies from a wood-burning oven, a full bar, a desert menu, and local delivery. All in all, quiet a pleasant surprise and a charming new place to try. Bodrum appears to be a low key place for couples looking for a private experience. Seating is limited-not a place for large groups. The restaurant has a website while has their menu, but the website is apparently still under construction and has not posted any photos yet.

However, I have been a customer for about a year now and perhaps can offer some insight into their curry.
Firstly, this is not Indian food as you would experience it on the subcontinent. This is more like the English curry place down the street. It has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that you have a consistency in the quality. The sauces are premade and retain their flavor. However, very few if any changes can be made (vindaloo comes as vinegary as the sauce was made originally); perhaps they can add more heat, however, they cannot take the heat out.
As a decent curry takes time to make, this is a better bet for a high turnover, take away style place than making slow cooked curry to order. 
Unfortunately the naan arrives quite soggy so I do not recommend ordering it for take-out.
All in all, if you are an ex-pat and miss your pub's curry, come to Dhaba (order from the English menu, much better than the mish mash on the rest of it). if you want to eat authentic Indian food, you are likely to disappoined. However, sadly, you are likely to be disappointed anywhere else on Curry Hill, too.
A few notes on delivery: they are popular. If you are unlucky, you may have to wait. However, most of the time food comes on time. Make sure they read back your order; the background noise does lead to misunderstandings easily.",Reminds me of the curry places in England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1367951-r186536276-Dhaba-New_York_City_New_York.html

You can usually tell if the place is good by the number of empty seats (or lack thereof) and the queue out the door.  On both visits in the last week there were no seats and a line out the door.  

The only negative I can give this place is that the noise levels can very quickly get to insane levels.  The low ceiling and narrow space amplifies this.

However, despite that it is a *MUST* visit location for sure.  The food is superb and fresh tasting.  I had the Kashmiri Rogan Josh (Lamb), this was spicier than I've had it before, but it really was good.  The increase spice was easily fixed with some wine.

Wow - I thought I'd died and gone to heaven! Indeed the Vindaloo was excellent, as was the Korma my wife had. Naans also really up there with anything you would find in England, and that is a huge compliment.

As to the restaurant itself - it was heavingly busy and we showed up literally 1 minute late and they were already calling us to see if they could give away our table - so be on time! Of course, that made it pretty noisy too - too noisy really - but at least it ended up slowing the service down a little from the usual US-focus of rushing everything.

The funniest thing was how dimly lit it was. I swear the lightbulbs must have been about 4 Watts and we had to use our cellphones as flashlights to read the menu. Seriously.

The garlic Naan is wonderful and cooked just right. We ordered two servings of white meat chicken tika marsala. The two orders of Basmati Rice were very enjoyable as was the mango chutney. So many items were ordered that I just cna't recall all of their names. However, I remember that every ordered item was excellent

As to some of the lower ratings for this or any buffet serving restaurant: We have dined here several times--always avoiding the Buffet as it's too mild and lacking in flavor. The problem with any buffet is--it's prepared mild for most people and kept warm. We always order our meals with medium spice level which really isn't that spicey. If this is your first time, just order mild.

To those who rated Restaurants based upon the BUFFET, get real. Buffets tend to be bland to appeal to the masses–nothing more or less. It is mild/bland food placed out upon warmers.

We demand that our food be cooked to order and served hot temperature wise–nothing more or less. For our dinner at DhaBa we ordered garlic naan along with chicken tikka masala and tandori chicken + rice. We did order an appetizer that had chick peas, sorry but I do not recall the name–it was so good that we ordered another! I usually order Indian food medium spice wise. This visit,  my Son & his Girlfriend joined me--- it was their first Indian experience, so I ordered everything mild. Also she had a nut allergy, so I asked if they could accommodate her restriction.

The lunchtime buffet there is better than the curry fare one is likely to find in the other Indian non-veg restaurants in the vicinity. Even so, the buffet, on the day we lunched here,  was just OK. For some reason, all the curries tasted the same even though they had different names. Among the stand-out items were the garlic naans and the piece of tandoori chicken which is served. Nothing that would make one want to go to this place again except if one is really hungry or one is in the mood for some curry. Two other let downs: The really dark interior and the very loud music. When requested to turn the music a wee bit down, the chief 'waitress' told us quite sharply that restaurants always have loud music. (I took the tone of her voice to mean: Get used to it, finish your buffet and get lost).

Two I was interested in were South Indian and one of our party was looking for meat, so Dhaba was our choice.  This was a pretty traditional Northern Indian (will go for the South Indian veg meals on our next trip!) with the addition of some fun chaats for starters.  I love Bhel Poori and this one did not disappoint.  My husband and I gobbled it down happily.  One of the best I have had lately.  We  also ordered a lamb keema which was nicely hot.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was kind of bland, but basically made my kid happy.  

When we first sat down, the music was bad Indian rock (or something!) and very loud.  After a while, they switched to a more easy-to-listen-to Bollywood style music.  The service was friendly but the place really packed up after we'd been there a while and it felt like it was starting to get stressful.  Tables are super close together and if we'd not been in a booth, I might have felt a bit like I was sitting in my neighbor's lap!  I had to do a little dance to exit the booth at the end of the meal.  Eeek!

As I said in my title, it would be best to arrive a little early.  We did so just around 6pm.  Generally, we find that eating a big, late breakfast and an early dinner makes for the least crowded dining situations in NYC.  We save a little money and have room for some street snacks by not eating three meals a day.  When we left the restaurant, there was a clutch of would-be diners waiting for tables.  Every other restaurant on the block ( and there are a ton of Indian restos here!) was practically deserted.  Good sign!

Eine gute Karte mit einer sehr guten Auswahl an Currys (außerhalb Deutschlands ist scharf übrigens in der Regel auch wirklich scharf und nicht nur würzig!).
Dazu eine gute Auswahl an Lassis und Bieren (Weizenbier vom Fass, Radeberger, Gaffel Kölsch und andere aus der Flasche für 5,-$/Flasche).

Alles recht preiswert gerade im Vergleich zu anderen New Yorker Restaurants. 
Es war sehr lecker und die Portionen waren reichlich. Wir haben nicht alles geschafft und den Rest unaufgefordert in Warmhalteboxen mitbekommen.

Reservierung ist definitiv wichtig. Wir hatten online reserviert und in der ganzen Zeit von 19°°-21°°Uhr war nicht ein einziger Platz frei! Die Gäste standen Schlange bis auf die Straße.

We had to wait 15 minutes for a table but the wait was well worth it. The resturant is small, so the food it cooked fresh and is piping hot. Being of an Asian back ground, you can rely on my view that the food was wonderful! very tasty, service was great and as we went after the rush on week night we got a nice romantic booth to ourselves.
