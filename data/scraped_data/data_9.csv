My latte was terrible and my daughters Matcha tasted like I would expect pond water to taste like. We love our morning drinks and there is way better in NYC.

This place is amazing! After years of searching for the kind of restaurant you might find back when being a server or maître d’, was an honored career and restaurants took pride in serving humans.

We had a drive to come to see a art show, stopped in before to see if we needed reservations- her smile and kind heart made sure we would return after knowing we had found a place to eat that was clean and really quite stylish and the menu was just interesting enough for all our guests!  

Out waiter Sean did everything right! He constantly kept his eyes on our table even as the outside filled in! 

I thought i should tell the manager how great his staff has been. That was truly the butter on the toast! Matty came over - humble- sweet and proud of his staff! 

I’m so into this place by this time - I can hardly believe the experience.

Anyway- to let you know why I’m even writing this review- my Dad owned 7 restaurants- my family is 7 generations of restauranteurs. My Dad won a night-hood for  his cooking- Maitre D’ Rotisseur. He became the president of the NY restaurant association and worked with the  owners of the 21 club. His restaurant were all 5 stars. They were in westchester NY - names: Le Shack, Le Bistro, Jasons, The Jockey Club!

We enjoyed it so much that when we planned on staying in New York again before sailing on a cruise up the east coast, we booked a hotel within walking distance of Cafeteria.  It was also centrally located for the cruise port…..  We went for an early dinner -reservations are a good idea if not mandatory.  We ordered their famous chicken and waffles.  They are also famous for their macaroni and cheese.  Both are great.  But I would say that this time the chicken was a bit over cooked.   The chicken was beautifully seasoned and crunchy but a bit dry.  The savory waffle was out of this world   We also found out that they only serve the Chicken and waffle until 6:00 PM.  Glad we made our reservation for 5:30.  They have an extensive breakfast menu which they serve until 4:00 PM.

Management here must be a disaster...if there is any management, that is.  
I recently called 2 days in advance to place an order for an important business luncheon. I was told not to place the order over the phone but to hang up and do it online 'so it doesn't get messed up'. I obliged and did it all online, including paying by credit card- well over $100, so not an insignificant order for a bakery. I arrived 2 hours after the order was supposed to be ready for pick-up. The girl at the counter was helpful, caring, and definitely trying her best, but she couldn't seem to find the order. So we needed to wait for someone else to arrive who supposedly had it. All the while the meter maid is outside trying to give tickets, so I have my son inside while I drive around the block a hundred times. In a nutshell, after waiting for a half hour, some men show up and when asked about our quiche, they respond 'we're going to Brooklyn now to make it'. Huh?? They are then surprised and appear annoyed that we didn't want to drive around the block for the next four hours while they travel to a different borough to make a quiche and then bring it back, and that instead we wanted our money back. 
Why did they not just say 'I'm so sorry, we completely forgot your order'??
Weirdest management experience ever. Fortunately I had 24 hours to the luncheon instead of 2 hours, but I had hoped to not spend my entire weekend cooking, which is of course what then happened. If the luncheon had been in 2 hours, my goose would have been truly cooked. Don't be caught up by the professional allure of the website..they don't know what they're doing over there.

I  was treated here for my birthday dinner. It was a great gift.
We were quickly greeted and seated after getting our temperature checked. It was early so not busy at all. The ambiance is modern, but cozy at same time. 

We started with the  cornmeal calamari appetizer. The calamari was nearly perfectly fried with only minor toughness. The flavor accompaniments of hot peppers,fried capers and horseradish sauce made up for it. The flavor combinations were spot on and I quickly forgot about any minor toughness of the calamari.

The shaved prime rib with herbed fries which was another winner. The beef was tender and juicy with a delicious au jus sauce on a wonderful sourdough baguette. The fries were excellent.

The ginger salmon with charred broccoli was a showstopper entree. Perfectly cooked and seasoned salmon was sauced with a bright and zesty ginger sauce.  The side of brocolini was fresh and crisp with excellent balanced garlic flavor.

To finish off meal we had an scrumptious pumpkin praline pie with bourbon whipped cream. This is the best pumpkin pie I've had in ages and among best I have had in entire life. You must have it if you're a pumpkin pie fan. The pie texture,sweetness and crust were flawless. The bourbon whipped cream sent it to an even higher level. 

Our server Eva was efficient,friendly and charming. A server who is there whenever you need them, but yet not constantly hovering. A class act.

We were excited to start our trip to New York by eating at this restaurant because it had been on sex and the city and the food looked amazing. We arrived at 7:30am on a friday and there was only one other table sat. 

The service started out great. The coffee was amazing and the avocado toast was really tasty. We were very impressed with everything and were having a great time. 

Cut to the check coming. We were a party of 5. Two of us had cash so we asked to have a certain amount put on three cards and the rest in cash. I get that is kind of a pain and understood why our server seemed agitated. I already knew I was going to leave more with my cash tip to make up for us being annoying. But then she comes back to our table and SLAMS down the check and says rather loudly and rudely ""You guys didnt give me enough! You are $3 short on the check!"" She then shows us a calculator with the math on it. We're all jetlagged from our redeye so we're not on our A game but give her another $3 in cash for the remainder of the bill. She then takes the money and says "" That's also no including a tip by the way! I usually put it on the card for people so they don't forget but you didnt give me that option."" Ok girl calm down. I'm a server so I get it. I also get that cash tips are better than cards and we had cash on the table for her 30% tip to make up for the split checks. But after being YELLED at by a server, I am not going to reward that behavior. There are better ways to handle this situation and I would never take the route she did. We promptly took back half of what we were going to leave as her tip and left disgusted by her behavior. 

If I ever did that at my bar,I wouldn't have a job anymore. I understand if you're having an off day but to raise your voice to customers and speak to them so rudely is not acceptable.

It's that simple. Everything here seems to be organic, fresh, and local. And you can taste the difference no matter how simple the dish. They can make it into perfection.

My friend and I happened to stop by on a lunch rush and this tiny bistro was packed packed packed. We figured it would be worth the wait since so many people all seemed to be migrating to this one location. We were certainly right.

The foods are definitely plentiful so you're getting what you're paying for. And the dish looks and tastes as fresh as can be. This bistro knows what's up in cooking with the best ingredients and making it into the best it can be. And the foods aren't even that complicated here. I think that's what I like so much about it. It's all simple dishes but it tastes really, really good. Simple but very flavorful, and healthy! That's an added plus!

The only downside was the wait, of course. There was a rush when we came in but we were the last to be served and to leave. I think we had to wait at least a good 30 minutes for our food but we're not complaining too much because it was all worth the wait. Not to forget but the interior art of this place is pretty cool to look at, so we were entertained. 

NOTE: Avoid lunch rushes or dinner rushes because it WILL be packed and the wait can get lengthy. I suggest coming a little later around 2 or 3 to avoid the crowds so you can eat leisurely and not so rushed.",PURE Food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60827-d3266418-r496013770-Pure_Bistro-Brooklyn_New_York.html

We prefer healthful foods that are not loaded with unhealthy fats or have too much salt but that have lots of fruits and veggies as sides.  We were not disappointed.  The food was excellent and the variety was great.  The coffee could have been better and they only accept cash and American Express, hence only a four circle rating.

I had the whole wheat pancakes with fresh berry topping.  These are the best whole wheat pancakes I have eaten in a long time.  They were not dense but had a great texture - being light but not turning to mush in your mouth.  The berry topping was actually just freshly cut up strawberries and blueberries artistically arranged on the pancakes and plate.  They are served with real maple syrup.  I also order the PURE salad - a mixed green salad with roasted red peppers, thin red onion strips, avocado and blue cheese dressing (I requested the dressing served on the side.)  Some of the lettuce leaves were too wet for me but I simply picked them out.

Our daughter ordered the salmon burger on a gluten free bun that was topped with grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce.  The salmon burger was actually just a piece of salmon, not a ground-up-filled-with-seasonings style of fish.  There was a small green salad on the side.

Very hip,  cool and contemporary.   It's surprisingly larger than expected.   

Menu is fresh and imaginative.   Nika, our server was friendly and professional.  Bottle of tap water with three glasses served right up.  I like that as we don't have to rely on servers to refill our glasses.  Wish more restaurants did that. 

Menu has starters like ""mom's guacamole"" and ""pop's hummus"" along with spicy sliders and quesadilla.  We split the hummus.  Delicious.   

I had the Greek salad with grilled chicken. Plenty of fresh salads on the menu.  

One associate ordered the Italiano panini, grilled chicken baby spinach, sun dried tomato, mozzarella and balsamic vinegarette.  He raved about it. 

The other ordered the viventi panini which was grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, and pesto on a multi grain panini.  Loved it!

Ambiance is laid back, beautifully decorated brick walls and wood tables with plenty of elbow room.  Low noise level Manes conversation easy. 

If you're in the Park Slope neighborhood stop by and enjoy Pure Bistro.  Tell Nika that Michael sent you!  Enjoy

We came by the restaurant as we were already staying in the hotel and wanted an easy option for dinner. I honestly wish I hadn’t, as I only had 2 positive experiences out of the evening. 

I will start with the positives (Unfortunately both don’t have to do with the food itself).

First, the piano music for dinner was lovely to listen to and really added to the overall ambiance of the restaurant. I’m a big fan of any venue continuing to support live arts. 

Second, the hotel owner came to every table to introduce themselves and interact with the restaurant patrons and that was a nice experience meeting with them.

I wish I could say that the evening continued on that wave of positive experiences. But alas, we ended up waiting an hour for food prepared in all sorts of disappointing ways. 

First off, my burger came out completely charred and overdone, when it was supposed to come out medium. When it was sent back, I was brought a small caprese salad, free of charge. A nice gesture, to be sure! But unfortunately, the tomatoes in the free salad were rotten! It felt like a total slap in the face at that moment. I then finally get my burger prepared properly and it is probably one of the most disappointing and bland burgers I’ve had in my life.

The rest of my party didn’t have good experiences either, two of which were waiting an hour just to get a bowl of soup? (Which is confusing to me, since it should be simple to prepare)

The other two in my party got the salmon and it was overdone, and the lemon sauce with it was NOT GOOD. The polenta with it was tasteless as well.

I ended the night disappointed and still hungry. Do yourself a favor and do not make the same mistake I did by coming here if you’re staying in this hotel (which we had other negative experiences with but I’ll save that for a review of the actual hotel).",This is the #1 restaurant in Staten Island???????,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48682-d1557202-r955273851-Lorenzo_s_Restaurant_Cabaret-Staten_Island_New_York.html

Unfortunately, the visit turned out to be a great disappointment :( It's very sad as we planned this for a while and the place indeed had all the potential to live to the expectations. But it didn't :( 
The food was decent; service was excellent and flawless; piano music was great, the guy played non-stop for 1.5h! However, there were two big tables which got occupied with large families shortly after we came. One was just next us with about 8 people and the other was one table away with about 15 people including children and even babies. Very soon it became so noisy we could hardly hear the piano. All these people didn't care about the music at all being fully occupied with their family gatherings. And then a baby started crying... We felt like sitting in a busy diner rather than an upscale romantic place :( The setting, the piano, the waiters in suits, the prices were not in line with what was going on. It was weird.

The food was pretty good but falling short of 5 stars on all dishes except soup.
Appetizers
	Bread basket with butter, olive oil, and ricotta - this one was on the house and it was excellent. Fresh, warm, perfect.
	Roasted Peppers with Fresh Mozzarella - this was a special of the day. The peppers tasted fine, but were most likely from a can, not freshly roasted. Mozzarella slices were quite tasteless with no dressing on top. We had to add salt on them the get some taste.
	Rooftop Kale Salad - this was fine, but could benefit from a bit more goat cheese and walnuts. It was mostly kale...
	Mushroom Soup - this was a special of the day. The soup was absolutely delicious! One of the best mushroom soups I ever had in a restaurant. This was the only flawless dish of the evening.

Mains
	Slow Simmered Beef Short Rib - the portion was good size, with nice presentation, sauce, and garnishes. The meat however was quite dry, certainly not melting in the mouth as the rightly cooked short ribs should be. On one side the meat was actually burned! :( I could request a replacement, but really didn't want to go into this and wait while my wife was eating. The salt level was on a higher side - ok, but on a border line.
	Basil Pesto Crusted Salmon - it was pretty good, though on dry side, not as juicy and tender as you would expect in such a place.

Desert
	Warm Apple Crumb - the tart with ice-cream was ok, nothing special. The white stuff they added around would be better off a whipped cream, but instead it tasted like a super sweet liquid marshmallow.
	
We cannot recommend this restaurant. They need to figure out their identity.","Decent food, nice piano music, but the atmosphere of a diner :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48682-d1557202-r939494095-Lorenzo_s_Restaurant_Cabaret-Staten_Island_New_York.html

When it finally arrived the risotto was undercooked and the ravioli fell off the fork (over cooked). The cream sauce on the ravioli was clumpy and overdone. The chicken soup was mainly broth and ridiculous. No one finished even half of their plates. It was one of the more awful dinners I’ve ever had.

Instead they sell sides of mashed potatoes for $4, and that is what I ordered, along with a $9 Portobello Burger.  I also had a Paradise Smoothie (pineapple, strawberry and banana) for $4.50.

The burger was good.  Not among the best burgers I've had, but good. One problem with it, though, was that the bun was so thick that I could hardly fit it in my mouth.  It came with a small amount of salad that was fit for animal grazing. 

I can say that the smoothie was outstanding.  I give the smoothie five stars.

The mashed potatoes were mashed potatoes.  I made a mistake ordering them - I was in shock after being told that they did not have french fries. 

The interior has two rooms.  The side I lunched on had one brick wall and another with black designs on a white background.  The table tops were laminated thick wood.  There was a long copper-coloured air shaft running along the ceiling.

I suspect that they don't have fries due to health concerns as this seems to be one of those places that sells organic stuff and all that allegedly healthy crap.

Hence decided to suggest it for dinner with my boyfriend. The food was still good, but the service was awful.

We had a waiter that didn’t write anything down when we ordered, came back a while later to ask what beer had been ordered as well as what entree one of had ordered. Finally got the beer, then my boyfriend entree came out but not mine.

Waited and waited and then asked where it was. Another person working there said they had forgotten to put the dressing in the side so that was what took so long ( presumably because the waiter hadn’t remembered it). 

We had asked for bread since we saw it another table and it looked really good (it was, when we finally got it). Another waiter checked on it for us and said it had 1.5 minute to go, as it was freshly baked. It was about 10. Minutes late when we asked a busboy if he knew where our bread was, and he brought it out.

Also had to ask someone else for water. The waiter had come to fill our glasses when we asked for it, but noticed something else must have been in his pitcher when he poured it, so he took the pitcher and the glass away with him,  but never came back. Again, had to ask someone else to bring a glass and water.

Maybe they are better staffed during lunch on weekdays, as that was a much better experience than this one, though the food is good.","Good food, horrible service",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d585221-r945778714-BXL_Cafe-New_York_City_New_York.html

Incredibly large menu, and this time, excellent service. Everyone enjoyed their food. The place was fairly full on a Friday evening, but unlike some other Staten Island diners, this one has a large parking lot. It, too, was pretty full, but we found a space without having to wait. 

So if you're crossing Staten Island, just take the Victory Blvd. exit, go toward the College of Staten Island (CSI) and you will see the Unicorn on your left. Turn just before the diner, and you can enter the parking lot, which will be on your left.

We thank God for Mikes Unicorn Dinner because it feels like home, the host prepares tables for our congregation kids  and all every Sunday night around 11 pm. 

The place is bright, clean and has a flat screen TV for all to see. The waitress knows us by name so the service is always good! The food is excellent and very fresh, anything I ever tried I really enjoyed and as you will see in the pictures I post I have tried many different dishes and never had a complaint.

But there is one thing I never change and that 's the soup I order, chicken rice with a motzo ball in a it! I like my food very hot and the soup always is, my usual order is a large salad with roman lettuce grilled chicken, portabellas mushrooms, carrots and grilled pita bread and I'm happy with it! 

I once tried a Ham & Swiss club sandwich with fries instead of the traditional turkey club sandwich and it was a pleasant surprise! one afternoon I stopped in for a light lunch and decided to go with the grilled chicken with cottage cheeses and mixed fruit, it was very good and satisfying!

one night I went for dinner and had the 14 oz NY strip cooked medium well it taste like I was in a expensive steakhouse in NYC! I'm also a big fan of french fries and I love to order them pizza style with tomato sauce and mozzarelle cheese which is a meal in it's self! 

And If you want to talk about desserts this is the place for you! NY is famous for their pies cakes & pastries and the unicorn has a great variety to chose from, my two favorites are the fresh banana cream pie and their NY cheese cake topped with real strawberries and coconut trimmings OMG! what a way to end such a great dinner. So I definitely recommend Mike's Unicorn Diner and if you need prayer my church is there on Sunday nights!",Late Night at Mikes Unicorn Diner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48682-d4106267-r284029567-Mike_s_Unicorn_Diner-Staten_Island_New_York.html

Meaning, instead of making the steak and shrimp combo they serve, just make the steak. The chef said okay and I  went to find a seat. 20 minutes later the Maitre'd asked if I  wanted the fruit I was eating while I waited, billed to my room? I was staying in a suite at the Hilton. I said, I'm waiting for my steak. He tells me, they never made my steak, he thought I  was joking, because who has steak for breakfast.  There were some other comments made that I  don't care to include, but long story short, even though the manager called me and apologized, in all honesty I wouldn't feel okay having anyone dine here without letting them know what they could be walking in to.

We ate there twice during our stay at the Hilton.  However, the reason that it did not get a higher star rating was that our service lacked the basics that lead to that higher rating.  Rather than assigning two wait staff to each table, every one was trying to do everything and none of it was done well.  We barely saw our waiter at our table because he was flitting from table to table across the entire room.  The people clearing the table cleared the entire table at the end of our appetizers.  Therefore, they had to replace everything on the table before our entrees came.  We overlooked most of that because of the food.  We had a variety of dished to sample the various dished offered.

We booked a 6:30 reservation on Open Table.  We arrived at 6:30, I told them I had a reservation, he didn't answer and took us to a table.  Waiter came by and asked what drinks we wanted.  I found it odd since we had no wine menu, which I had to ask for. Waiter was obviously distracted with another party going on, so there was a delay for everything.  We skipped wine since it took 10 minutes to get the wine menu.  Special Risotto was Chicken Picatta (chicken breast over risotto with asparagus). It was gross. The rice was just ""white rice"", not aborrio and not cooked well. Tasked like white rice with cream mixed into it, not well cooked risotto.  Chicken was tender but lacked taste.  Needed lemon desperately and seasoning. Overall: Horrible.  I had a sausage pasta with broccolli raabe.  It was gross.  Floading in a pool of liquid.  I don't think it was brocolli raabe, honestly it appeared to be more like collar greens, cooked to absolute death, total mush, turned brown in color.  Sausage was ok, but it was so saturated by the gallon of liquid it was almost like soup.  Good turnout for America's worst cooks, but far from what you should get at a ""fine"" restaurant.  This place obviously thrives off parties and events and suckers from the hotel, like us.  Not the restaurant's fault but they seated an annoying couple next to us. The lady laid down on the chairs and talked on the phone the entire time, when she did sit up to eat, she still was having a full blown, full volume conversation going on.   We waited for the check, and told the waiter the food was not good.  Another long wait and the manager brought the check and argued that it was only an hour since we arrived and that we should have said something earlier (and she was probably right, but we try not to complain and make a scene).  She offered to send cookies to our room (we declined) and that was about it.  Not good food, not good service, not good management.  We'll see how our ""free"" Hilton Diamond Member breakfast turns out in the morning.  I would NEVER EVER EVER EVER recommend this place for dinner.  Its just bad, overpriced, horrible food.","One of the Absolute Worst Meals of All Time.  Horrible, Disgusting.

If you are a patron of the orchestra you can request two rehearsal tickets a year. A great experience.

Unfortunately the dining experience was not as expected. I arrived at 12:45 and told reception that I had a reservation. She looked it up and took me to a two top in a facility that was about 50% full. The next morning I got  a dunning email from Open Table indicated I was not a responsible person for not canceling the appointment. I emailed OT the receipt number and name of the server. They replied they would let the restaurant know that their staff was incompetent.

I ordered the Moules Provençale, a dish that I have had any times in Brussels which the restaurant attests to as being their main product and ethnic origin.
 
Erin, my somewhat efficient server, brought the dish out about ten minutes later. The mussels had properly opened under the steaming process, but the cook then proceeded to douse the dish with cold garnishings and sauce. I ate about 5 and gave up. The frites that came with the dish were fine. In Belgium this product comes with half a loaf of French bread to soak up some of the sauce. No bread.

Erin asked how I liked the dish. I told her it was cold. Her reply “I will tell the chef”. I think the “chef” already knew that. No offer to adjust the bill of $43.55 which included their house brewed beer.

They have a good beer selection. The menu is limited (not a lot, but enough between beef, fish, sandwich options). The server was friendly and helpful. He suggested the mussels or the Belgian beef stew. That is what I was looking at. The stew seemed to be more of a gravy or sauce with the beef. Also came with prunes in the stew.

One of the people in our party ordered a club sandwich, which is supposed to come with french fries, cole slaw and pickles, but the last two were not provided. And it was hard to try to ask, and the waiter was one of those who suffers from that eye disease where they don't see the customers and stay away from them. Generally, the food is good, but it was clear that the club sandwich was NOT their strong point, as the meats in it were very fatty. The other meals (belgian waffles, whole wheat pancakes and an omelette were fine, although one request for well-done fries was ignored.

I'm willing to believe that the waiter, and maybe the kitchen, were having a bad day, but if it continues to happen, I'd remind Mike that there are other diners on Staten Islan that aren't part of the Mike's Diner empire, and I can go to them as easily as to the Unicorn.",Maybe they were having a bad night last night...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48682-d4106267-r206063670-Mike_s_Unicorn_Diner-Staten_Island_New_York.html

Though the personnel is friendly, the intervals with which they inform if everything is okay, or that there may be anything else with which they may serve one, is just too frequent and makes one feel a bit awkward.

Our waiter was super sweet and at one point the manager came over to greet us and she was really nice as well. I order the silver dollar pancakes and it was soooo good! I’m not sure what syrup they used but it was light and added a nice flavor to the pancakes and the fruits. I did order the Rude Margarita but the spicy flavor wasn’t my favorite.

Or have in the past anyway. We went late after seeing a play on Broadway. We were seated quickly by very friendly staff at the door. 
That’s where it all went down hill. 

Our waitress was very aloof. Taking forever to get our drinks. We were more than ready to order when she returned with them. When I said we’re ready to order, she gave me an amused half smirk and said ‘I’ll be back’. I didn’t want her to come back...I wanted her to take my order!

The cheeseburger was ok. Very bland. Needed salt or seasoning terribly. There were no salt shakers on any tables and I wasn’t about to ask Ms. I’ll be back for anything. The fries were terrible. They are super thin, which would have been great, except they looked and tasted like they had been thrown in lukewarm grease and cooked very slowly. The grease taste was overwhelming. 

She got my friend’s order wrong even after she pointed out what she wanted on the menu. 

We quickly ate what we could and then asked that the check be divided up. She then told us ‘we don’t split checks here’. Well the table next to us had 3 different checks! I could clearly see them. 

At one point I was making eye contact with her as she was laughing it up with her co-workers at the counter. She kept on talking and made her way over when she finished.

Once we were, we had a server come up to us to take our order, walked off mid taking our order and never came back.

(The font size of the restaurant name, BXL, was no larger than that of the signs for the Duvel brand, and there two Duvel signs versus one BXL sign on the awning.  I'd suggest rethinking that design choice.)  

This is effectively a sports bar.  A game was playing on several large screens throughout.  There was an extensive list of alcoholic beverages.  I get the sense that this would be a good place to go for beer aficionados, especially of the Belgian kind.

The service, quite delightful.  Better than I would expect of most pubs, at least the dives anyway.  Friendly, warm, energetic, enthusiastic.  Spot on.  We actually had more than one server for our table, which was a bit confusing at first but it worked out fine.   Both were great.  I should mention that one item that we had ordered was forgotten when the main entrees were brought over.  As soon as we realized it, I asked for it, and to their credit, they were on it right away, and soon enough it did come to our table. 

The food, I thought overall was terrific.  Well, the starting bread was just all right.  Soft but not warm, and the butter was a bit cold and not easily spreadable.  But the truffle croquette appetizer was excellent.  Highly recommend that.   As were our steaks.  I had the ribeye with the peppercorn sauce, and the kids each had hanger steak with shallot sauce.  The Mrs. had the stewed sirloin tips in beer sauce.  We all shared some of each others' dishes and I thought everything was good.  However she did mention later on that hers was a bit on the tough side.  But at least the sauce was very flavorful and probably helped compensate.  

Each of our dishes came with wonderful fries.  Perhaps that might be a reflection of the fact that French fries were invented in Belgium?  This was my first Belgian cuisine experience so it's hard for me to confirm at this point.   Either way, these fries were the tops.

And let me say, I thought the mac and cheese side dish was great. At least the Mrs. and I liked it. Surprisingly for us, though, the kids didn't care for it very much.  We had ordered it for them, as mac and cheese is by and large their favorite dish to order when we go out to eat.  I think that their palates were not used to the type of sharp cheese that was used.  This was a mac and cheese for grownups, apparently.  So, big thumbs up from me, but be careful about ordering if for the younger ones, even the ones that normally adore mac and cheese.   

My main misgiving about this choice of establishment for my family's dining is that toward the tail end of our meal, there was some rather loud and rough language being used by some of the patrons, the kind to which I try to avoid exposing my kids (though, to be fair, my oldest kid has heard it all before by now, and my younger kid probably didn't notice).  I don't consider it a fault of the establishment.  It goes with the atmosphere and the clientele to which it caters.   For next time, it will be a factor in my decisionmaking about whether to come back for another meal with the children.  

So, all in all I really like the place as a restaurant, and besides that, I expect it would make a good choice as a place to meet up for beers.  But as a place to take the whole family including children, be aware of the kind of place this is.","Nice service and high quality food, in an unassuming location and a casual atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d585221-r739719210-BXL_Cafe-New_York_City_New_York.html

You also have a tray with a choice of toppings— butter, oil, or a spread. Bread types are: Olive, Annisette/ raisin, whole wheat, Italian.
There are also a variety of salads to choose from.  My favorite is the Limoncello with sun dried cranberries, candied walnuts and
Granny Smith apples and baby greens covered in a special thyme dressing!  $9.00

I had the salmon which was served over broccoli rabe and roasted potatoes— all cooked to perfection! ($24)

I also had the sorbet- lemon and raspberry. The texture was very smoother, flavor was great. Excellent and a generous portion! But there are many desserts to choose from including peach Melba and molten chocolate lava cake. ($8.00)

Topped off with a cup of cappuccino which was a bit too bitter - and I drink Starbucks lattes!

The waiters were very friendly and attentive!!!

The total bill was about $40.00 without the tip.  But I did order one of the more expensive entrees.

Overall, nice atmosphere, lots of choices, great service, good food.

I am a frequent patron of your restaurant, often late at night when my colleagues and I are off of work. I enjoy the flexibility and relaxed atmosphere of the venue. On Monday February 19th at approximately 8pm, during my recent visit to your restaurant, my boyfriend and I, an African American couple, were greeted by host Everett Smith. Everett informed my boyfriend that there was a new policy implemented regarding hats, and he was to remove his hat in order to be seated. Prior to our arrival, I called to inquire if the location was busy and if there was a wait. I was not informed over the phone that there had been a new policy implemented regarding hats for males. 
I informed Everette that this was not our first time here and we had never encountered an issue because my boyfriend wears hats frequently. He then responded we will not be seated if he has a hat on. I then requested to speak to manager, Josh Greenapple, who again informed us there was a new policy not allowing men with hats to be seated. I brought to his attention 3 Caucasian males, seated within plain view of the host desk, who were enjoying their meals with hats on. I asked Josh how he could rationalize that we are not able to be seated when there are clearly 3 males with hats on sitting at tables. I asked Josh if he could kindly inform the males of the restaurants new policy regarding hats. Josh then became very loud, boisterous and began gesturing his hands very closely to my face. His attitude quickly became very unprofessional and he stated he didn’t have time to deal with my situation because he had other things to handle such as the death of one of his employees grandparents. Josh informed me that Everette had given them instruction to remove their hats before they were seated and it was no longer his problem to address them again being that they were seated. 
I then went to your online website to search for the newly implemented policy regarding no hats for males and found nothing related to the information given to me at the restaurant.

The discrepancy here is that there is a new policy being implemented solely at your establishments door, not online or over the phone to inform individuals prior to making their way, that hats are prohibited. Secondly your new policy is being impartially executed. We visited the establishment where we were told to take our hats off when 3 males in plain view of the door were seated and eating with their hats on. We were not spoken to respectfully or with courtesy. We took our business elsewhere. My family and friends are no longer interested in contributing to a restaurant whose staff and policies are unprofessional and premature.

However, the Cafeteria is nothing like an actual cafeteria. This restaurant is beautiful inside and outside, especially during the holidays. When we arrived at the restaurant it was covered in snow, and in white Christmas lights. It was kind of like love at first site. Wreaths hung on the walls and lit up the windows! There were also several Christmas trees. Even though the restaurant was filled with people it was still intimate and romantic. The Cafeteria is perfect for any date, even though I saw lots of big groups. 

We ordered: 

-Mac and Cheese Spring Rolls w/ Smoked Gouda Dipping Sauce. They tasted interesting but I still liked them.  

-Deviled Eggs, pretty basic but good! 

-A side order of fried polenta (it was a special request to order separately). I love polenta! 

-Fried Oreos, always a good choice!

-Red Velvet ding dongs with a milk shake. Surprisingly just ok. I wouldn't order it again. 

-Service was excellent, from the hostess, our server, but especially the manager. They let me modify the order and took special request. Hooray for letting me be difficult and then feeding me dessert! #boyfriendgoals 

This place is open 24/7 and has a nice bar and lounge for people that like to drink. I'm personally more into the food than the drinks so that's all I can tell you about the bar. As for the food, there are 3 different menus, all day, dinner, and overnight. I have my eye on their Croissant French Toast dish!

The mussels were available in a variety of styles and it smelled wonderful in the restaurant. 

I really wanted the French Onion soup, so I skipped the all you can eat mussels but supplemented with the Mussels Farcies. The soup was SO good that we went back the next night after a show just to have it. The cheese on the soup was great. I don’t think it was the standard gruyere but whatever it was was perfectly toasty & melty. My Mussels Farcies were so good, off the bar menu. They were topped with garlicky bread crumbs and baked and there were about 2 dozen of them. My friend had the roast chicken & fries. It looked delicious, and she said it was but maybe a little dry. 

Our server was super friendly, and we met people at the next table who invited us to their restaurant later that night for drinks which we took them up on.

The counter is very busy with people drinking the great selection of excellent Belgian beers and the tables fill up fast. Add to the omnipresent TV screens and it makes for a loud, rowdy environment - a cafe, not a restaurant.
We went there on Monday night, when they have ""all you can eat mussels"" : there was confusion about the price, advertised on the bill @ $ 26, but charged @ 29 (the Belgian manager said they just went up and the cash register had not been adjusted yet, but insisted on charging the highest price - of course).
The mussels were mediocre : small (but that depends on the season, not necessarily on the restaurant) with very watery stock, very salty fries and tasteless mayo (why not follow a simple, Belgian recipe ?!). The beer is imported Belgian, so brilliant, but better take out a mortgage before ordering another round.
Being Belgian, I make it a point to try Belgian restaurants around the world - this one does not rank on top of my list.",Go for the beer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d585221-r644213080-BXL_Cafe-New_York_City_New_York.html

In real life it is a 3 day process, so they had cream and pastry already prepared for them to use for the day.  The class was fun and limited to 8 people so they all had hands on time. They left with their own Mille Feuille as well as the raw pastry dough they had made.  I think it was a fun 2 1/2 hour experience.  There were couples doing it together as well.

We had a nice time visiting with each other, but sadly the restaurant was underwhelming.

First, my drink (old fashioned) took quite a while to arrive, and was a pretty skimpy pour. Even with the small pour, it seemed watered down.. which was disappointing.

The lunch was not bad - all three of us had a salad.. my brother and Aunt went for the chicken salad special, which they said was quite good. I had a calamari salad - it was a good portion, and the taste was pretty good - but it didn't wow me at all.

Service was terrible. Our waitress barely stopped by the table, and was basically oblivious to her guests needs. Water ran low frequently and my empty drink sat on the table until the salads were gone - then I was asked if I'd like another.

Overall - food was okay but uninspired, and the poor service would prevent my return. ",Visiting with Family - unimpressive lunch ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d457893-r521597180-Cafeteria-New_York_City_New_York.html

After the religious ceremony about 30 of us went to Cafeteria for the after ceremony luncheon.  
Cafeteria was very busy, but they had a private room ready and waiting for us. As soon as we got there, we were brought into the room and seated. No waiting for anything. The waitress Alex watered our glasses, gave us some time to gather ourselves, then started to go around the table and take drink orders. She was very pleasant and extremely efficient. 
Our host at set up a menu with them with choices for appetizers, main courses, and dessert. Everything was so well thought out. I could tell that our host in the restaurant staff worked very well together. Our waitress, Alex got all our orders perfect.  Some of us had special requests including myself, nothing came out mixed up. The bus staff and the runners were excellent, food came out fast, was hot when it needed to be hot and was delicious. Somebody was always available when we needed something. Presentation was beautiful. Even management came out to help with service.
When it came time to bring out the birthday cake the waiters and management came and joined in the singing and the cake was beautiful and delicious. Again, I must say everything that I ate today was delicious! 
I had tomato soup, meatloaf with mashed potatoes and string beans, and for dessert I had a chorizo with ice cream and our cake again was delicious.
I must complement the staff, especially Alex our waitress, the bus staff and the runners. Management should be very proud of the event they ran today, on top of having a full restaurant.
Being former restaurant management I was very impressed with the operation, and the quality of the product. 
If I was still in the business today, I would look to hire the staff away from Cafeteria, they are very lucky to have them. Alex was a joy as a waitress.
I highly recommend the place.

We liked it so much we came back for a family birthday. I would suggest making a reservation as it can get quite busy. The appetizers we ordered were fantastic - mac and cheese egg rolls, calamari and pesto polenta. The polenta in particular was truly perfection. The drinks are also great and they're open to suggestions if you'd like to tailor a drink to your preferences. My mother raved about her off-menu muddled blackberry tequila drink. Nice minimalist atmosphere and friendly staff as well. I have only 2 complaints: first we ordered warm lobster rolls which is the 'Friday Blue Plate' Special and it was extremely disappointing. The lobster was barely warm, rubbery and not fresh. I even chomped down on a giant piece of shell and promptly lost my appetite. For a special they only make once a week- it should have been fresh and well made. Second, we had a trainee serving us and I ordered a ginger iced tea mocktail. Apparently this drink is made in large batches and they grind the ginger by hand which should have been mentioned when I ordered. It took the entire meal for me to get my drink and it was clear that the trainee had forgotten to check on it multiple times. It would have been best if she had offered a similar drink as a suggestion rather than allowing me to wait for 90 minutes. Despite these little issues, I would recommend this restaurant hands down. It is the best app place ever and has such a great vibe. I will definitely be back very soon!

So salad - very good, other aspects of meal not so good and hence the average rating.  We sat outside - hot day - and you are right near the subway grates.  It was tolerable but our tables were majorly wobbly even with the shims.  Keep that in mind.  I had the salmon quinoa salad ($17) with teriyaki salmon chunks, avocado, kale, quinoa, and pickled beets - this hit all the salad sweet spots for me.  I nibbled on some truffle parmesan fries ($8) that someone else had ordered - shoe string fries done to perfection with a wonderful truffle flavor.  Had a corona bottle ($7).  Also sampled the quinoa based veggie burger which was tasty but very crumbly and crumbled onto my white shirt leaving me with a big stain for the rest of the night - don't let the crumbliness steer you away from it, the taste was great.  But for the issues of service - our waiter seemed well-intentioned.  I think some of the issues may have been in the kitchen - not quite sure.  But we got the wrong entree - that went back right away.  But the correct entree took about 25 minutes to come back out.  Fortunately I eat slowly so I was still working on my salad but the other two folks had finished their meals.  And the truffle fries, while tasty, were not hot.  So some problems somewhere there.  But I like the menu and I would go back but sit inside.",My salad was great but....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d457893-r503692249-Cafeteria-New_York_City_New_York.html

This place has seen better days. It is dark and frankly because it is so dated looking it looks dirty. Having said this I give it a solid 3. The food was not bad, far from amazing but solid, albeit over-priced. We had calamari, country paté, mussels (broth could use more flavor) and amazing fries (like real Belgium style potato fries). The wine was a decent sancerre and the waitstaff attentive and professional.  4 glasses of wine, 2 cokes and some appetizers cost about $150.00-including tip.  If I went back it would be for beer and fries pre-theater only. Not a destination eatery for me. If you are in a bond before a play it is the better of choices in a far too expensive area of NYC.

This is apparently a happening Chelsea hot spot.  It’s open 24/7 so the menu goes from breakfast to whenever.  Naturally the décor is minimalisticly stylish.  Before noon on a weekday, the place is jammed for lunch.  There are lots of very good all-day choices.  Burrata is always a good place to start…especially with olive tapenade and toasted French bread.  Unfortunately, there’s not enough bread and they bring more, but a half hour later.  Some people opt for house made potato chips with caramelized onion dip that’s reminiscent of an exotic high school treat.  Mac n’ Cheese spring rolls are killer with a funky cheese (doubling down) dip.  I have old school meatballs richly seasoned with herbs and house-made tomato sauce and ricotta …excellent.  The grilled salmon BLT was a real winner.  A couple of us had burgers which I think should be reserved for when nothing else on the menu sounds any good.  The restrooms had a problem…no toilet paper.  Service was problematic since it was so crowded.

While there has been the occasional glitch, it was always handled professionally and the food was always excellent.
This year started well. We were seated promptly and drink orders were taken. My husband asked for his salad without nuts- which he doesn't eat - and was told that they had 750 diners that evening so nothing was being made to order .  He tried fried  calimari instead. They seemed to have been previously frozen hard rings of bread crumbs with no fish inside.  The salad, ordered by our daughter, seemed to have been just portioned out of a large pre made salad, no presentation and she was told she couldn't have the dressing on the side. My seafood salad was very good. The pasta courses were good. For the main course I had the seafood stew, an excellent choice. The salmon stuffed with lobster seemed to be another previously frozen choice, couldn't find any lobster and not much taste. The vegetarian option eggplant parm arrived ice cold over mashed potatoes - really? In an Italian restaurant - and had a very bitter after taste. When we asked for a different hot portion, the waiter refused and brought instead a plate of grilled zucchini and asparagus -  neither of which she really eats.

The short rib was super tender and had a beef reduction sauce on top that was extremely flavorful. We had six in our party and we had only one complaint, and it was a dish that had broccoli rabe in it. It was bitter and spicy with an aftertaste that we didn't like. Very earthy flavor in the rabe. Prices were steep, but the service was phenomenal. Daniel was our server and he was there to make sure everything was top notch. My wife got ill towards the end of the meal and left the table.

We found the hotel very very nice and Lorenzo's restaurant was a bonus.

By filling out a brief survey, we were treated to our choice of a free drink, app, or breakfast at Lorenzo's, and opted for the app at dinner time.

The restaurant is spacious and elegantly appointed.  We ate at about 8:00 and there was live piano music in the dining room, which was very nice in the background.  There was a mix of large and small parties (as the hotel had a number of events happening simultaneously).

Our free app was the antipasto plate which came with prosciutto, salami, olives, red pepper, figs, dried apricots, and a variety of hard and soft cheeses.  Very tasty and comped for our having filled out the short survey on our room.

My wife had gnocchi with roasted brussel sprouts and bacon. I'm certain it was delicious as I tried my share!  I had the farro salad served in a bed of arugula with avocado and cucumber.  Also very good.  Well prepared and well seasoned.

Service was very good, attentive without hovering.

The next day we ate breakfast in the same restaurant.  It was a standard breakfast buffet, with a nice variety of hot items, breads and pastries, with fresh fruit.

Food was fine, with one small flaw- the sausage and bacon was not served to temp and a bit cool...

Our meal as described with 2 soft drinks and a beer was $40 (with the antipasto free).

Otherwise a good overall experience.",Nice Atmosphere and Good Food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48682-d1557202-r279983331-Lorenzo_s_Restaurant_Cabaret-Staten_Island_New_York.html

Not an extensive menu but a nice varied selection. We had the Grilled Branzino and Ginger Salmon. Would highly recommend both. Servers and support staff are very attentive and pleasant.
On the negative side. The noise level is quite high. Very difficult to have a decent conversation with the person seated across the table from you. Next, the establishment introduced me to the practice of rounding the bill, up in my case, to the nearest nickel. Restaurant policy I was told upon inquiring. After which my itemized bill disappeared. I'll be following up with DCA. Pretty sure it is a violation of NYC code. It's not the pennies, it's the principal of the thing. I did not see a notice of this policy listed anywhere either. Searching the web, I see this practice has been going on throughout the country for some time. Surprised we have not stumbled across it sooner as we do eat out regularly. I'm not sure patrons even realize this is happening. My query to the server drew a perplexed stare and he had to go find out the answer. Lastly, do your own math when calculating the tip. This establishment has joined an ever growing legion trending toward offering you a 'suggested tip' at the bottom of the bill that is based on the total bill including any taxes. 
There are those that may say I'm being petty, but I say, give em an inch........ I have seen posts where the rounding is to the nearest dollar.

The price was not spoken, and after inquiring, it turns out the ""daily special"" which was supposed to be $20, was now $32! This bait and switch is annoying.

Since summer I have started noticing changes. There are no gluten free menu's anymore available and it depends of how complacent the waiter is to help substitute ingredients in dishes to make them gluten free. It used to be that a lot where gluten free but now with the menu changes it is very limited. I have had a waiter that was super helpfull and one a time that was not. They also have no bread alternative. Everyone gets bread to start, there is no option they want to accomodate you with. no cucumber slices instead.
The new chef is clearly not aware of dinner trends 2017. 
Also you can now make reservations they said. so instead of walk in you can now set have your table waiting for you. will try it out next time.

It’s one on those things, different strokes for different folks, but we were so pleased to find this place. We order the lamb sausage and harissa baguette + the steak burger baguette, 3 beers, 2 glasses of wine, 2 Cointreau + 1 margarita in a pear tree, and we shared a waffle (don’t judge us, it’s my birthday) $125.37 all in. Have paid a lot more for an awful lot less! Lamb sausage baguette was especially good, tasty sausage and nicely spiced. Steak burger was also good but comes cooked a European medium (rare). Waffle was incredibly light (don’t know if it was homemade, but very good.

Aangezien wij zelf uit België komen wisten we wel dat in New York iets typisch Belgisch eten waarschijnlijk niet hetzelfde zou zijn als thuis. Maar het was gewoon echt niét lekker. Over de bediening kunnen we niets slecht zeggen, alhoewel er op voorhand gevraagd werd aan de uitbaters om kaarsjes te voorzien voor de jarige was hier helemaal niets mee gedaan. Ze wisten zelf niet dat iemand jarig was. Het eten dan, was écht ondermaats voor de prijs ! Mosselen waren niet te eten, half rauw en de groentjes ook. Daarnaast nog 14$ betaald voor een kriek en we kwamen op onze duurste rekening uit in NYC. Wij komen alleszins niet terug.

As we entered we saw that this was a sports bar with blaring TVs all over the place and guys 4 deep at the bar. The noise level was HIGH as were many of the men at the bar. We walked to the back where there are tables and chose one at the very back of the place but it made no difference.

The food (traditional Italian, it seemed) was wonderful! Reasonably to low-priced for Manhattan and the dining area was far enough away from the bar that quiet conversation could be had.

I ordered my food at the food station close to the entrance and went immediately to the bar to order my beer while the food was being prepared.  The bar was busy but seemed fairly adequately staffed, yet I waited and waited for probably 15 minutes while others to the left and right of me were served over and over again.  The servers from the food stand tried to serve me my food TWICE while I was standing there and I had to ask them to take it back twice, as I had no place to put it.  I finally came to the conclusion that the woman with the short curly hair behind the bar was deliberately avoiding serving me, as there was absolutely no way she didn't see me there for so long.  I was quiet and had been patiently waiting for her to finally get to me, and she even made very brief eye contact with me one time and then quickly looked away.  I was very hungry and my food was getting cold so I had to finally give up and ask the restaurant folks (who were very helpful tonight) to pack it up to go.  I was soooo disappointed!  I had been planning to listen to the live music there.  What a terrible and frustrating experience.  The food was very good (hot chicken sandwich and green salad)...would have been much, much better with a beer.

It’s actually a very good pub that could be classified as a restaurant. The host/hostess for the eatery is located at the end of the bar, mid way through the establishment. I didn’t have a reservation, but the host found me a table for one (I was solo on another business trip).

Overall cleanliness: typical bar, not clean but not filthy

Bathroom cleanliness: typical bar, not clean

Service: By American standards, service is a bit slow. But BXL has a very European vibe. Hurried, frenetic service of the large chain restaurants in nearby Times Square fortunately is not present. Relax and enjoy a pace of eating and service that is much more Continental. Also, I never felt rushed. Although I parked at my little table and slowly drank beer and ate my meal, I never felt hurried or that I was impeding the flow of guests. 

Food: Very good food. I had the onion soup served with homemade sourdough, soft loaf bread. The soup and bread were wonderful. The CARBONNADE FLAMANDE (stewed sirloin tips in brown beer reduction gravy) was so tasty and the portion was huge.

Beer: Nice selection of fine Belgian ales on tab and extensive selection of bottles. Beer on tap ranges from $9 - $12 per glass, but that’s typical for Belgian ale. The house Cuvee BXL is a fine brew (low ABV, very modest hops, mellow throughout) and would be a great “gateway” Belgian for beer explorers not familiar with Belgian ales.",A hidden Belgian gem so close to Times Square!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d585221-r488040413-BXL_Cafe-New_York_City_New_York.html

Janice was extremely pleasant and gave me great advise on the Belgium beer and food and kept me fairly entertained and occupied before my wife came. Also, at that time there were not too many patrons in the restaurant. Suffice to say, the beer was excellent and I had 3 servings, and the food was delicious.

Maybe the problem is that we went for dinner vs. it's outstanding reputation for lunch/brunch.  It was fine. The food was OK, the service pretty good.  But what is all the fuss about the Mac and Cheese at this place.  We ordered the lobster Mac & Cheese since it is one of my husbands favorites.  First off -- they just put a few chunks (a good amount for the portion size --which is tiny) on the top of the casserole versus mixing it it.  I think that because of this service style, the lobster is ice cold while the Mac&Cheese is very warm.  Not a pleasing sensation in your mouth. The Lobster Mac&Cheese at Capitol Grill can give this version soe real lessons on how that dish is supposed to be prepared..  Giving credit where it is due, the burger was great.  Cooked perfectly and juicy.  The real problem with this place was not the food but rather the crowd.  It is unclassy, trying to dress up as classy but not succeeding.  I am a heavy person and you would not catch me dead in some of the outfits I saw. I believe in embracing your inner and outer beauty.  But if you are the only one who thinks your outer beauty is so great, please don't display it in away that accentuates what others do not consider beautiful.  I can not believe I am writing this, but as a heavy person, I find ways for me and others to appreciate my beauty both inner and outer, without looking grotesque. We were at a very intimate table for two and we could not converse because the noise was so loud.  It was like a screaming convention -- who can talk the loudest.  And what the were saying was in RAP, so who the heck could understand them anyway.

There were four of us (two picky teen girls and two mature ladies) on this Sunday morning.  While there is a good brunch selection, three of us ordered waffles; one ordered pancakes.  The pancakes are actually supposed to be banana pancakes, but we were able to request plain pancakes... a fresh, plain batch was made.  We really appreciated that.  The waffles come with fruit (kiwi, strawberry, pineapple and melon) and whipped cream.  The waffles were good, but the pancakes were really delicious.  

The cappuccino was perfect!  Everyone else ordered juice - grapefruit, orange and apple.

The service was good.  Our orders were taken quickly and our special requests (as I said... two picky teens) were granted with no problem at all.  There are two televisions airing at the time, soccer games.

We briefly shared a spot with some folks who were there before us who were kind enough to let us use half of their table for just a bit.

They make a nice variety of beers here in the brewery.  I tried two of them, and they were both refreshing summery-type beers, but I don't remember their specific names.

While we had always talked about trying to make them, after looking at all the steps involved I knew it would be a disaster (I'm not much of a cook/baker)  When I saw Le Mille Feuille's macaron class, I knew that would be a great birthday present and fun experience for both of us.  And they did not disappoint.

With only 8 people in the class, each of us received individual attention.  While I'm not much of a baker, there were a couple of people in our class with much higher baking skills.  However, I never felt uncomfortable.  The teacher (wish I could remember his name because he was very French and wonderful) was patient with all of us and met each of us at our level.

It was not crowded, but still took a while to get seated and acknowledged.  Staff was not friendly, generally speaking.

Ordered risotto with scallops, a special that night.  Took a looong time to get it.  Had a basket of pretty stale bread in the meantime.  Came with olive oil and butter which I liked.  

The risotto was fairly bad.  I guess there were scallops in it, but just fragments.  Almost seemed like canned.  On the plus side, it was served hot, and the portion good.  

Had two glasses of wine - dinner was $44 before tip - this was just dinner for one.  In that price range I expect at least pleasant service.  

The place was comfortable and convenient, but I don't think I'd go back.  Seems they do a lot of weddings and funerals - the one energetic person in the place was the gal coordinating a wedding with the bride and groom - I should have sat with them!  They were having more fun than the poor business schlub who just wanted a decent dinner.","Pretty bad, even by hotel restaurant standards",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48682-d1557202-r154584908-Lorenzo_s_Restaurant_Cabaret-Staten_Island_New_York.html

We wanted to go for a drink and had been told that the Hilton had a nice rooftop.  Well, the rooftop was closed because it was too early (they open at 9:00 pm) and Lorenzo's is right next door and part of the Hilton.  I asked for the Chicken Marsala which came with spinach and mashed potatoes.  The marsala sauce was quite different from any other I have ever had.  It was dark, dark, almost black.  The spinach was tasteless and the mashed potatoes could have been better seasoned.  It was edible but could have been better for the price.  The ambiance was romantic and fine.  There was a piano player.  The waiter and bus boys were quite attentive to us.  It was a pleasant evening overall, perhaps we should have asked for different things on the menu.  Would we go back?  Yes, why not.  And this time around try something new.  Go with children?

We enjoyed the experience the first time, so it was a no brainer as to where we were eating with our second visit to the area.
They have a piano player which lends to the pleasant atmosphere.
The food both times was very good.  The service was also very good.
Favorites:  Lemon Chello Salad, Gniocchi and the Whole Wheat Pasta with sundried tomatoes.
They offer a nice selection of bread with butter, olive oil w/ spices and a vegtable spread.
Salads run about $8 for a good size.  Entree start at around $15 and up.
The House wines were decent.
We did not try any deserts...we were to full from the meal.
The resturant is located in the Hilton Garden, but you wouldn't know it once you were inside the resturant.

Enjoy!!",Nice Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48682-d1557202-r153469417-Lorenzo_s_Restaurant_Cabaret-Staten_Island_New_York.html
